    </header>
    <main>
        <p>
            Did you know that under Islamic rule all non-
            Muslims, including Hindus had to pay a huge tax
            just to remain Hindu? A tax just to retain their
            dharma? A tax of being non-Muslim; a tax of being
            a Hindu. Read on.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image1.png')"></div>
        <p>
            It wasn’t a quirk of one Islamic ruler. It is the
            Islamic law - Shariat. It is not just legal but actually
            obligated upon a Muslim ruler to implement the
            Jizyah tax on all their remaining non-Muslim
            subjects. For this it is important to understand the
            Islamic psyche first.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dr. Harsh Narain, a scholar of Nyāya-Vaiśeśika,
            did a wonderful study on Jizyah and what impact it
            had on the rise of Islam in India in 1990, published
            by Voice of India. The book was titled ‘Jizyah and
            the Rise of Islam’.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image2.png')"></div>
        <p>
            I will use Dr. Narain’s words, &amp; denote them
            by quotation marks. “According to the Prophet,
            every child is born in Islam, but its parents make it
            a non-Muslim.” (Bukhari, I, Kitab al-Janaiz,
            H.1295) So non-Muslims (Hindus) are usurpers
            and illegal squatters in Islamic view.
        </p>
        <p>
            “The Qur’an declares the Muslims to be the best
            community and raised up to guide and govern
            humanity (Al 'Imran (3) 110), as vice-regents of
            God on earth (An-Nur (24) 55; an-Naml (27) 62)…”
            So Muslims are entrusted to take care of the
            property of God (entire earth).
        </p>
        <p>
            “…and Islam is the chosen religion (Al 'Imran (3)
            19, 85; al-Ma'idah (5) 3.), destined to triumph over
            all other religions. (At-Tawbah (9) 33; al-FatH (48)
            28; as 'Saff (61) 9.)” So Muslims are the caretakers;
            Islam is the chosen religion; and it is destined to
            win.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the reason Islamic kingdoms and
            communities have such a deep conquering
            mentality. They think it is their right to take away
            others’ properties and lands. They think it is their
            duty to conquer the lands and properties of others
            and they think they will never lose.
        </p>
        <p>
            “The Qur’an also says that the earth belongs to
            Allah. ‘He causes it to be inherited by whom of His
            servants He will'. ('Inna 'I-arDa li-' llah-i; yurithu-
            ha man yyasha'u min 'ibadi-hi' Al-A'raf (7) 128.)
        </p>
        <p>
            “On the basis of it all the Prophet rules that all
            land belongs to God or himself, the natural
            corollary being that all land belongs, through God
            and the Prophet., to the Muslims.” ('A 'Iamu ann al-
            arDa li 'llah-i wa rasu-ihi'. Bukhari, II, Kitab al-
            Jihad wa 's-Siyar, H.406.)
        </p>
        <p>
            “This serves to vouchsafe to the Muslims the
            moral right to grab lands in Jihad from non-
            Muslims. Ibn Taymiyyah, the 14th-century Muslim
            jurist-theologian, said that Jihad simply restores
            lands to the Muslims, who enjoy a kind of Divine
            right over these.”
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image3.png')"></div>
        <p>
            First point to notice is: according to the Muslim
            psyche, all non-Muslims, including Hindus are
            living on Muslim lands and thus are illegal
            squatters. Thus:
            1: They can be evicted;
            2. If in any case they are allowed to live, they have
            to pay rent or tax.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Islamic law commands the Muslims to
            despise the idol worshippers like Hindus. They are
            called as ‘najas’. And they are not allowed to be
            even near the holy Ka’bah.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ayatollah Khomeini wrote: “Eleven things are
            unclean: urine, excrement, sperm, blood, a dog, a
            pig, bones, a non-Muslim man and woman, wine,
            bear, perspiration of the camel that eats filth.” (Bat
            Ye’or, The Dhimmi)
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image4.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Ayatollah continues: “The whole body of a non-
            Muslim is unclean, even his hair, his nails, and all
            secretions of his body. A child below the age of
            puberty is unclean if his parents and grandparents
            are not Muslims…”
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image5.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Second point to notice is: We, the non-Muslims
            (Hindus), are illegal squatters on Muslim lands,
            and on top of that we are as dirty as pigs and as
            filthy as wine. So we are committing the sin of
            dirtying the legal land of Muslims by squatting on
            them with our filthy bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Third important point is that the Quran
            commands Muslims to convert non-Muslims. It is
            their sacred duty. Non-Muslims have three choices
            – conversion to Islam and death by sword, but
            there is another choice which results from the
            above reasoning.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a surprise to Muslims, non-Muslims like
            Hindus didn’t accept the one true religion of Islam
            easily. They would willingly choose death over
            conversion to Islam. And in those times, it was
            simply impossible to kill all Hindus, perhaps the
            most numerous people on earth.
        </p>
        <p>
            To confront such situations Muslim lawmakers
            came up with a third solution: Jizyah tax. The
            Kaffirs could stay non-Muslim, if only for a few
            years, by paying a hefty tax – the tax of being non-
            Muslim. It was not different from protection money
            in today’s world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jizyah tax solved many problems.
        <ol>
            <li> It gave the Islamic kingdoms a huge source of
                revenue without much difficulty.</li>
            <li> It gave them the satisfaction of insulting Hindus/
                non-Muslims. (explained in later threads, how) </li>
            <li> It encouraged them to convert to Islam. </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            The third point was most important. Jizyah was
            such a back-breaking tax that over the generations
            it forced non-Muslims like Hindus to renounce
            their dharma and accept Islam. Jizyah would
            humiliate them, impoverish them, and make them
            hate their dharma.
        </p>
        <p>
            Islamic kingdoms grew religiously &amp;
            financially through Jizyah. That is how they
            financed their wars of conquest in other lands by
            taking Jizyah from non-Muslims. This is how
            humiliating it was for Hindus to live under Islamic
            rule. Coming threads will talk on this.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like most laws in Islam, the tax of Jizyah also
            arises from the Quran. The verse ordering the
            imposition of this tax came after the Prophet
            captured Mecca in 630 C.E. The verse says refusal
            to convert to Islam translates to a tax.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image6.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Holy Quran Chapter 9: Verse 29: “Fight those
            who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and
            who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His
            Messenger have made unlawful and who do not
            adopt the religion of truth from those who were
            given the Scripture…”
        </p>
        <p>
            “…[fight] until they give the jizyah willingly while
            they are humbled.” Chapter At-Tawbah (9:29)
            Jizyah thus becomes compulsory. And if non-
            Muslims have to be ‘tolerated’, then that toleration
            is monetized with an aside of humiliation of non-
            Muslims.
        </p>
        <p>
            Different Islamic lawmakers have different
            opinions on who is eligible for Jizyah. While most
            believe that only Jews and Christians are eligible
            for it, and idolaters like Hindus should just be put
            to death, it was sheer impossible to do that in those
            times.
        </p>
        <p>
            Imam Malik, one of the four greatest jurists of
            Islam and one of the Islamic scholars whose
            tradition – the Maliki school of Islamic
            jurisprudence – is one of the four great Islamic
            traditions – he allowed Jizyah for Hindus too.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image7.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Jizyah is a price for exercise a religion other than
            Islam. By imposing heavy tax on just being non-
            Muslim it encourages conversions to Islam. Thus
            Jizyah is a Jihadic impost. It is a punishment of
            ‘unbelief’ according to Islam. It is a tool of
            humiliation of non-Muslims.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only thing that non-Muslims get back from
            Islamic rulers is a promise of not being
            exterminated for a certain period of time. It is
            essentially protection money demanded by religious
            mafia. Hindus are allowed poor and basic existence
            under it, but just that.
        </p>
        <p>
        <ol>
            Jizyah is a tool of:
            <li> Fiscal Jihad – It seeks to destroy financial
                backbone of non-Muslim society.</li>
            <li>
                Humiliation – It seeks to insult non-Muslims to
                shame them out of their dharma. </li>
            <li>
                Islamic Jihad – In long-term it is a tool to slowly
                turn the non-Muslims towards Islam. </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Mujaddid-I Alf-I Thani, an Islamic scholar
            contemporary to Jehangir believed that the primary
            purpose of Jizyah was the humiliation of the Kafir.
            It was meant to destroy the dignity of non-Muslims
            to the point where they are depressed enough to not
            even wear good clothes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thani wrote: “'The real purpose of imposing
            Jizyah on them (the Kafirs) is their humiliation.
            And the humiliation goes to the extent that for fear
            of Jizyah they may not put on good dress and live
            with dignity/in prosperity and they may always live
            in fear trembling.”
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the theory of Jizyah. In subsequent
            threads we will look into its history.
            Reference for tweet 10: “12. For a detailed
            discussion of the concept of 'unclean', see Anwar
            Shah Kashmiri, FayD al-Bari (on Bukhari), I, pp.
            361-363.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The first implementation of Jizyah was done by the
            Prophet himself on the Nazranite Christians of
            present day Yemen. The Nazranites were a great
            &amp; prosperous culture of the Arabian peninsula
            of those times.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image8.png')"></div>
        <p>
            They were forced to pay Jizyah the treaty
            (protection promise) could be revoked anytime
            from the side of the Muslims. Thus, after the
            Prophet’s death, first Caliph Abu Bakr honored the
            treaty, but the second Caliph Umar revoked it for
            ‘Arabia could have no non-Muslims’.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Nazranites were forced to leave Arabia and
            settled in a new town in Kufah outside Arabia, but
            that part also became Muslim soon after and they
            were forced to pay Jizyah on them. In a few decades
            Jizyah was increased many times &amp; Nazranites
            disappeared from history.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus an ancient people were destroyed and while
            they died they financed the conquests of Islamic
            armies. Arabic has a word called ‘Nazrana’,
            meaning a gift, which is famous in north India too.
            Very few know the history behind it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever Jizyah was too high, and more non-
            Muslims paying it would convert to Islam and thus
            stop the back-breaking tax. Whenever this
            happened much, some greedy Muslim princes
            would lessen the Jizyah to keep the coffers flowing,
            thus discouraging conversions.
        </p>
        <p>
            But when it was too low and not many were
            converting, a religious prince would increase it so
            that more non-Muslims would convert. However
            the direction towards conversion to Islam was
            definite as all these countries became completely
            Islamic later on except a few.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jizyah tax was fixed on a town or a community
            and not on individuals in most cases. So as more
            non-Muslims converted, the rest of the non-
            Muslims who did not convert to Islam had to pay
            more tax per capita to keep practicing their
            ancestral religion.
        </p>
        <p>
            This encouraged the rest of non-Muslims paying
            Jizyah to convert more, which led to more tax on
            those who didn’t convert. It was a vicious cycle
            which always aided the conversion to Islam. Jizyah,
            more than anything else, was a tool of conversion to
            Islam.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes when non-Muslims had no money
            left to pay Jizyah, the Muslim masters would give
            them the ‘option’ to sell their wives and children. In
            some cases, they did, like in the case of Barqah
            town near Alexandria when Muslim commander
            Amar bin al-‘As gave them the ‘option’.
        </p>
        <p>
            Non-Muslims, ‘protected’ by paying Jizyah, were
            called Dhimmis/ Jimmis. Muslims, taking tax, were
            called ‘Jimmedar’. This is the origin of word
            ‘Jimmedar’; it means a Muslim who is responsible
            for collecting religious tax from Hindus.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image9.png')"></div>

            Dhimmis/ Zimmis were not citizens. They had no
            rights. Neither political nor fundamental. They
            were never appointed to any position of power.
            They could never exercise voting of any kind. They
            could never lead an army.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many disabilities were inflicted on Dhimmis.
            They could not:
        <ol>
            <li>Couldn’t build new temples.</li>
            <li>Couldn’t repair temples destroyed by Muslims.</li>
            <li>
                Couldn’t sound bells in their temples to
                inconvenience Muslims.</li>
            <li>
                Couldn’t display their dharmic symbols openly.</li>
            <li>
                The Dhimmi had to open his house, shop and
                temple to any Muslims who wished to stay. </li>
            <li>
                Couldn’t do their chants inside their own temples
                loudly.</li>
            <li>
                Couldn’t stop any relative from converting to
                Islam.</li>
            <li>Couldn’t dress like a Muslim.</li>
            <li>Could not ride horses or camels.</li>
            <li>Could not use Arabic.</li>
            <li>Could not buy or keep arms of any kind.</li>
            <li>Could not make their houses higher than
                Muslims.</li>
            <li>
                Had to stand up for a Muslim in a public
                gathering.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            These terms were meant for 1) The suppression
            and disappearance of the religion &amp; culture of
            non-Muslims; 2) Constant insult of non-Muslims to
            encourage them to convert to Islam 3) To make
            them incapable of fighting or standing up to Islamic
            rulers.

            We see that a lot of these infirmities are still upon
            the Hindu society. The government funds minority
            institutions but not Hindu ones. Muslim majority
            areas force the Hindus to stop displaying their
            religious symbols in public. Muslims stock arms
            while Hindus don’t &amp; can’t.

            Muslim lawmakers cite a letter by Caliph Umar
            as a document to implement Jizyah in subsequent
            years and other places. The letter allows Christians
            of Damascus to continue their religion by paying
            Jizyah. Let us go read the terms in full.

            You can see that this letter decided most of the
            disabilities that were inflicted upon non-Muslims
            paying Jizyah
        </p>
        <p>
            Jizyah was allowed to Hindus in special
            circumstances. Yes, even a punitive tax was
            considered a boon for Hindus by Muslims, because
            Hindus were ‘filthy idolaters’ for them and
            considered only death or conversion to Islam.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image11.png')"></div>
        <p>
            It was impossible to kill all of Hindus, who were
            in crores. So Jizyah was allowed to them.
            Muhammad bin Qasim started with it in Sindh in
            early 8th century. And from him to Aurangzeb
            almost every Islamic ruler kept imposing Jizyah on
            Hindus, barring Akbar.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Qaḍi of Alauddin Khalji wrote: “'If the
            Jizyah-collector asks a Hindu for silver, the latter
            should offer gold in all humility. If the collector
            wishes to spit into his mouth, the latter should open
            his mouth without demur, so as to enable the
            former to spit into it.”
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image12.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Firoz Shah Tughlaq wrote that because of Jizyah,
            “'the Hindus thronged in clusters after clusters and
            groups after groups and were glorified by the glory
            of Islam. And likewise to this day of ours, they come
            from far and wide, embrace Islam, and Jizyah is off
            from them.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Aurangzeb reimposed it after Akbar had
            abolished it and Jehangir and Shahjahan had
            followed him. But even then local Muslim princes
            kept levying Jizyah. Aurangzeb restarted it. When
            Hindus opposed the imposition of Jizyah he had
            them trampled with elephants.
        </p>
        <p>
            He also demanded that the Hindu Dhimmi
            should carry Jizyah in his hand and come on foot.
            He should pay it standing, while the Muslim Jizyah
            collector is sitting. His hand should be below that of
            the collector who should snatch it from him, saying
            ‘Pay Jizyah, O Dhimmi!’
        </p>
        <p>
            Clearly the goal was to humiliate the Hindu so
            much that ultimately he would convert to Islam. In
            Aurangzeb’s reign, even roaming mendicants and
            sannyasins had to pay it. Dr. Harsh Narain assesses
            that it was Jizyah which led to conversions of
            Hindus to Islam in India.
