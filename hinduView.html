            Hindus don’t realize but their own religion, culture,
            society &amp; civilization is interpreted by others.
            And not just indifferent others. The story of Hindu
            dharma is being told by its worst enemies: the
            monotheists.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image1.png')"></div>
        <p>
            They are enemies because they very clearly and
            actively seek the destruction of Hindu dharma,
            Hindu society and the Hindu way of life. In the
            Christian and Islamic scheme of things, Hindus are
            the worst sort of beings because they are ‘idolaters’.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is natural for civilizations to have enemies.
            What is not natural is that Hindus turn against
            their own benign culture and civilization. That they
            start seeing Hindu dharma from the Judeo-
            Christian lens. But this is exactly what has
            happened.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our media, academia, politics and even society
            has been infested with interpretations of our own
            dharma from the eyes of our worst enemies. This
            game has become so advanced that we are not even
            aware that we are looking at ourselves from the
            enemy’s eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The saints of Hindu Renaissance like Swami
            Vivekananda and Shri Aurobindo had called for
            inverting the gaze and most particularly Swami
            Dayananda had done a pūrva pakṣa of Islam and
            Christinaity but that movement got aborted during
            the run for independence.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image2.png')"></div>
        <p>
            It was Shri Ram Swarup, who for the first time
            after this, gave the call for inverting the gaze. In a
            way, he along with Shri Sita Ram Goel, inverted the
            gaze, which meant: looking at Islam, Christianity
            and Judaism from a Hindu point of view.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image3.png')"></div>
        <p>
            It was an attempt to actually tell the Hindu story
            from a native point of view and to reclaim our
            fundamental right to look at the world in our own
            ways; to reclaim our ways of knowing, looking and
            expressing. Shri Ram Swarup did this vocally and
            deeply through his works.
        </p>
        <p>
            His first observation about Christianity and
            Islam was that they lacked inner spirituality. Hindu
            dharma recommends meditation to find the
            ultimate truth, these religions said that the ultimate
            truth is found and written in their Book. Shri Ram
            Swarup says:
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image4.png')"></div>
        <p>
            "What forcibly strikes a discriminating student of
            the Bible is that its god lacks interiority. Though the
            Bible exhorts its followers to love their god with all
            their heart, yet throughout its long career there is
            nothing to show that it knows of a "god or gods in
            the heart".
        </p>
        <p>
            Shri Ram Swarup says that the Judeo-Christian
            and Islamic God also lacks universality despite all
            claims to the contrary. This God seems to be
            concerned overwhelmingly with the affairs of
            Middle Eastern deserts and was extremely partisan
            to one group of people.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is okay to respect one’s deity but if one starts
            thinking that other gods are evil and should be
            eliminated, the trouble starts. The Biblical God is
            like that. Shri Ram Swarup says that this
            disparaging thoughts about others’ gods comes
            from rājasika-tāmasika citta bhūmīs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most defining feature of Prophetic
            Monotheism – One True God – was established by
            Judaism itself. "By the time Jesus came the cult of a
            one god and a special people was well established."
            And he added the Seal of Prophecy to it, saying that
            no more Prophets can come.
        </p>
        <p>
            The lethal combination of Prophetic
            Monotheism was building. Shri Ram Swarup has
            dwelt upon this process and nature of monotheism
            in his works and most importantly he has analyzed
            that process through the point of view of yogic
            spirituality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shri Ram Swarup explains how the lethal blend of
            Prophetic Monotheism was created by Christianity.
            Judaism wasn't particular on conversion.
            Christianity added it.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image5.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Jesus started his career by trying to become a
            Jewish prophet. The initial times are marked by his
            words which seek audience only in Jews. It was
            only when Jews considered him dangerous enough
            to bring Roman ire on Israel that he turned his
            attention to Gentiles.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image6.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Gentiles were the pagans of Israel/ Palestine of
            those times. And this change of audience in
            attention from Jews (monotheistic people) to
            Gentiles (pagan people) has its marks on the
            character of Christianity, mainly in the things that
            it borrowed from both cultures.
        </p>
        <p>
            From Messiah to Savior
            "Jesus himself was converted from a Messiah into a
            Saviour, into God's First Begotten Son, the
            Intermediary between God and man. This indeed
            was a great leap and a great promotion from the
            humble figure of a Jewish Messiah."
        </p>
        <p>
            Jesus's story is sold as a unique happening in the
            history of mankind. But that’s false. When
            Christianity was born there were too many saviors
            around. Mithras, a Persian god, famous in Roman
            Empire had a story too similar to Jesus. (All quotes
            are Shri Ram Swarup’s words)
        </p>
        <p>
            "Mithras was born on or very near the 25th of
            December, of a Virgin Mother and in a cave; after
            he was buried he rose from the tomb; he had twelve
            disciples and the members of his order were
            admitted with the ceremony of baptism; he was also
            called a Saviour."
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image7.png')"></div>
        <p>
            There was another Babylonian Sun-god, Baal had
            rituals associated with him which enacted a passion
            play resembling to actual life of Jesus. All these
            gods predated Jesus. So it seems, the entire
            biography of Jesus was a cultural ensemble played
            by the Church.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image8.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Many scholars have thus claimed that Jesus
            never existed and even if he did, he was born and
            died like a Jewish prophet, killed by Romans for
            revolting against their authority. All the ‘savior’
            claims, virgin birth, resurrection etc. are copied
            from other gods of Western Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
            One might wonder how is Christianity to blame if
            it stole many of its rituals from pagan sects. The
            answer lies in the particular cocktail that
            Christianity created from its borrowings. The
            lethality of the combination comes from
            Christianity’s Jewish roots.
        </p>
        <p>
            For all the virgin births, resurrections and cult
            behaviors, none of the pagan sects ‘hated other
            gods’, sects and religions. It is this ‘hatred of other
            gods’ is what distinguishes the monotheistic
            religions from everyone else. Shri Ram Swarup calls
            it – Misotheosy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Misotheosy – literally meaning – the hatred of
            gods – is what made Christianity what it is. For it
            meant that it was not just proud of its own beliefs;
            it hated the gods and beliefs of others’ so much it
            wanted to end them as ‘false beliefs’ and ‘devil
            worship’.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image9.png')"></div>
        <p>
            "Christianity borrowed from Judaism its
            scripture, its prophets, its belief in a special people
            and a special covenant, and above all its jealous
            God, its hatred for 'other' Gods, and consequently
            its proverbial hatred of mankind - misotheosy is the
            parent of misanthropy."
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            The cocktail was brewing:
            <li>Hatred of other gods – Misotheosy</li>
            <li>Denial of other gods’ existence – Monotheism</li>
            <li>Concept of mediator to God – Prophetism</li>
            <li>God’s chosen people – Unique Destiny</li>
            <li>Man is born sinner – Original Sin</li>
            <li>Jesus as God’s son – Only Begotten Son</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus all the features which make Christianity
            dangerous, violent and intolerant come from the
            mother of prophetic monotheism – Judaism.
            Christianity added many things of its own, like the
            idea of Jesus as God’s Only Begotten Son. And the
            idea of conversion.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image10.png')"></div>
        <p>
            All its cultural accoutrements come from pagan
            sources, which are of course distorted to fit the
            monotheistic bill. It is also telling because most
            monotheisms are pure ideas without cultural
            embellishments, which they always have to steal
            from other cultures.
        </p>
        <p>
            There was another lethal Judaic idea that
            Christianity borrowed – Atonement. In pagan sects,
            one can attain powers by sacrificing animals in a
            proper ritual. In Jewish religion this was distorted
            where one had to sacrifice one’s own first born like
            Abraham &amp; Isaac.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image11.png')"></div>
        <p>
            It is said that God in his mercy accepts
            substitutes. But Christianity came up with a
            brilliant idea in case of substitute. They said that
            since man’s sin is eternal, the atonement has also to
            be eternal. And who better to do it than God’s Only
            Begotten Son – Jesus?
        </p>
        <p>
            "The cross is central to Christianity. All before
            leads up to it and all after looks back to it. After
            making sin into a formidable dogma, its remission
            is made simple enough - just baptism in the name
            of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.”
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image12.png')"></div>
        <p>
            “Sin is no more a problem for the followers of
            Jesus.” This was a fundamental break from the
            past. Previously some form of the idea of karma
            always existed. You had to reap the results of your
            actions. Now it was not so.
        </p>
        <p>
            One could commit as many sins as one wanted.
            He just had to ‘believe’ in Christ by converting to
            Christianity. And Jesus would have already washed
            his sins retroactively in the past for any sin that he
            commits in future! Never before had such an idea
            struck anyone!
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image13.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Before Christianity people were judged on the
            base of their actions. With this Atonement thing, it
            all changed. Now people were judged on the basis
            of their belief, since action meant nothing if there
            was no ‘correct belief’. Coming threads will delve
            more into this.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is necessary to understand the Muslim psyche in
            order to understand the problems of co-existence
            that all non-Muslim societies encounter with them.
            The Quran and the Hadith are the sources.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image14.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Shri Ram Swarup did a deep study for years on
            these sources and came out with a book called
            ‘Understanding Islam through Hadis’. Islam is
            basically a system of law, overarching law which
            covers all aspects of life. To understand Muslim
            psyche these laws have to be studied.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image3.png')"></div>
        <p>
            “Islam is not merely a theology, or a statement
            about Allah and his relationship with His creatures.
            Besides containing doctrinal and creedal material,
            it deals with social, penal, commercial, ritualistic,
            and ceremonial matters.” It leaves nothing to
            individual discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
            “It enters into everything, even into such private
            areas as one’s dress, marrying, and mating. In the
            language of the Muslim theologians, Islam is a
            complete and completed religion.” Every human
            action is pre-decided by Islam. Nothing is left to
            imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
            “It is equally political and military. It has much
            to do with statecraft, and it has a very specific view
            of the world peopled by infidels. Since most of the
            world is still infidel, it is very important for those
            who are not Muslims to understand Islam.”
        </p>
        <p>
            For Islam, to be good is secondary. What is
            primary is being a Muslim. “The acts of virtue may
            be good in their own way but it is by coming within
            the fold of Islam that these become significant and
            meaningful in the eyes of the Lord.” - Shahi Muslim
        </p>
        <p>
            Not merely that. To belong to another religion,
            even by birth, is a great sin. “Which sin is the
            gravest in the eyes of Allah? he replies: “That you
            associate a partner with Allah.” – Shahi Muslim
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like that monotheism is the best virtue. “If
            polytheism is the worst of crimes, monotheism, by
            the same token, is the best of virtues. Muhammad
            is asked about the best of deeds. He replies: Belief
            in Allah. What next? he is asked. Jihad, he replies
            (148)”. (Shahi Muslim)
        </p>
        <p>
            This is what non-Muslims/ Hindus need to
            understand. Not by our actions but by our birth and
            faith, we are sinners in the eyes of Muslims. We do
            not follow the only true religion of Islam. Grave
            crime. We follow multiple gods. Worst crime. In
            Muslim eyes, we are criminals.
        </p>
        <p>
            They hate us because they think our very
            existence is wrong; because we follow the wrong
            religion; because we worship the wrong gods;
            because we are ‘living in sin’ because we are
            Hindus. There hate is not individual. It is moral,
            religious and collective.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any plan of ‘co-existence’ needs not just deal
            with the conflicts that the two communities of
            Hindus and Muslims find with each other. Any
            such attempt needs to deal with the very Islamic
            theology because that is where roots of intolerance
            are to be found.

            Does general public morality have a place in Islam?
            As it turns out, it does. Islam is not devoid of
            morality, and its scriptures are full of moral
            injunctions, with one significant difference.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image16.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Morality in Islam is faith based. It is sectarian.
            There are no universal moral principles in Islam
            which are applied on everyone. There is always the
            distinction between the Momin and the Kaffir – the
            Muslim and the non-Muslim – the believer and the
            non-believer.
        </p>
        <p>
            “A Muslim owes everything to the ummah, very
            little to others. He has no obligations, moral or
            spiritual, toward non-Muslims as part of the human
            race, except to convert them by sword, spoils and
            jizyah.” Ram Swarup in ‘Understanding Islam
            through Hadis’.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image17.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Sincerity, for example, should be a universal
            value practiced with everyone. In Islam, sincerity is
            highly prized too. But not with non-Muslims. In
            Islam, sincerity is limited to Muslims.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Prophet defined Islam once as “sincerity and
            well-wishing”. A very good definition generally. But
            then he is asked, “Sincerity and well-wishing for
            whom”. He replies: “For Allah, His book, His
            Messenger and for the leaders and general of
            Muslims.” (Shahih Muslim 98)
        </p>
        <p>
            This has led to a twisted set of morals in which
            really high morals are preached to Muslims for
            Muslims, but when it comes for practicing the same
            thing with non-Muslims, the set of morals are
            completely skewed. Never has there been the out-
            group so ‘othered’ as in Islam.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, destroying and looting the property
            of polytheists (Hindus) is completely allowed and
            given legal status as ‘ghanimat’. But stealing the
            same stolen stuff, once it is property of a Muslim is
            a mortal sin.

            One slave who converted to Islam died fighting in
            war for Islam. So he deserved Paradise as per
            Islamic laws. But he was given a place in Hell by the
            Prophet for stealing a small ‘garment’ from another
            Muslim.
        </p>
        <p>
            Speaking on the twisted morals which result
            from this significant ‘othering’ of non-Muslims,
            Shri Ram Swarup says: “To rob a whole people is
            piety, but to remove a paltry something from a
            looted treasure is moral depravity of a magnitude
            that deserves eternal fire.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Shri Ram Swarup says: “Men driven by ordinary
            temptations indulge only in petty crimes and small
            lapses, but committing real enormities needs the
            aid of an ideology, a revelation, a God-ordained
            mission.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image19.png')"></div>
        <p>
            There are five pillars of Islam which are considered
            indispensible for following One True Religion.
            These are: Shahada (Profession of Faith), Salat
            (Prayer), Zakat (Alms), Sawm (Fasting), and Hajj
            (Pilgrimmage).
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image20.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Shahada - the very profession of Islamic faith
            makes any co-existence with any other religion
            impossible. "I bear witness that there is no deity but
            Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the
            messenger of God." No other form of God is
            allowed, nor any other prophet.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image21.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Any possibility of coming together with any other
            religious community, any rapprochement becomes
            impossible because it is being declared that all
            other forms of gods are false gods, and any deity or
            guru attempting to help anyone is an imposter.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shahada declares Hindu gods to be false, our
            deities and gurus to be imposters and makes us
            virtually devil worshippers. When the very
            profession of faith in Islam is so intolerant of
            others, how hypocritical it is for their followers to
            cry intolerance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Salat - Salat, prayer, is very important and
            second pillar of Islam. In Shahi Muslim it gets the
            longest attention of jurists. But all of it is just full of
            manual instructions and legal injunctions upon
            failure to follow procedure.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image22.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Shri Ram Swarup says: “But in all these pages,
            one looks in vain for any reference to such
            problems as self-exploration and self-knowledge,
            problems of enduring concern for the spirituality of
            the Indian tradition…” (Understanding Islam
            through Hadis)
        </p>
        <p>
            He continues: “There is not even a remote hint of
            different men endowed with different natures
            taking different paths toward a divinity differently
            figured. As there is one Allah, one Guide, one Book,
            there is also one Prayer, caught and fixed in a single
            formula.”
        </p>
        <p>
            A follower of Islam can at best pray and hope for
            intercession on his behalf. There is nothing he can
            ‘do’, no ‘action’ that he can take to better his
            situation. Contrast this with Hindu ethics where
            everything depends on one’s actions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Zakat - Charity is an exalted action in almost all
            societies. It has central place in Sanātana society.
            But in Islam charity (zakat) has been weaponized: 1.
            It is compulsory. 2. It is used for the purposes of
            Jihad.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Quran (9:60): The alms are meant only for
            the poor and the needy and those who are in charge
            thereof, those whose hearts are to be reconciled,
            and to free those in bondage, and to help those
            burdened with debt, and for expenditure in the Way
            of Allah and for the wayfarer.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Those whose hearts are to be reconciled’, are
            non-Muslims who are yet to convert. ‘Expenditure
            in the Way of Allah’ is the way of Jihad and the
            spread of Islam. That has always been the primary
            motive of zakat expenditure. It’s a wonderful
            system of funding religious wars.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sawm – The laws of fasting in Islam which lets
            you eat before dawn and after dusk makes it very
            clear that these are laws for a group of fighters who
            can’t afford to eat while the Sun is up and war is
            going on, but should eat as much as possible when
            it is dark.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduViewAsset/image23.png')"></div>
        <p>
            It just shows how the conception of a Muslim
            society is like a warrior society. It is most evidently
            not a civil society. It is a society at war with all its
            neighbors. It is a society always at an emergency
            mode.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hajj – Pilgrimage is a pagan idea, repurposed
            for Islamic goals. Hajj keeps up donation to Islam,
            indoctrination in its tenets a central goal and keeps
            Arabia as the center of power and global respect.
            Shows how Islam repurposes pagan cultural motifs
            for monotheistic goals.
