        <h1>Origin of Biryani</h1>
    </Header>
    <main>
        <p>Nonsense! <br><br>
            Biryani is NOT Mughal dish.Its earlier name was "Hindavi Laziz" ="Indian delicacy"
            The word Biryani is NOT Arabic, Persian,Turkic. It originally comes from Sanskrit
            word borrowed by Persian.
            Early Biryani with meat, rice &amp; spices was known as मांसोदन in Ancient India
            Biryani is made from rice and spices.
            In those days, Rice DID NOT EVEN GROW in the original Mughal homeland.
            Infact, the first Mughal emperor Babur DOES NOT EVEN MENTION mention rice
            when he was in Central Asia. He mentions other crops and cereals but rice is
            completely ABSENT
            The Persian word 'Biryani' is comes from Persian 'Birinj' for rice. Now, this word is
            NOT FOUND in Old Persian. It suddenly occurs in Middle Persian. According to
            Mayrhofer's "Etymological Dictionary Of Old Indo Aryan", the word Birinj comes from
            Sanskrit word vrīhí (�ीिह).</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('Biryanirakhshak/image1.png')"></div>
        <p>Biryani is basically a dish made with rice, meat and spices.
            Such a dish known as मांसौदन is mentioned even in vedic literature.
            It is mentioned in Śatapathabrāhmaṇa (11. 5. 7. 5 &amp; 14. 9. 4.17)
            Pāṇini in his Aṣṭādhyāyī also mentions it at 4. 4.67
            ( correcting मांसौदन)</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('Biryanirakhshak/image2.png')"></div>
        <p>An ancient Indian book on food known as Pākadarpaṇa (पाकदप�ण) is attributed to king
            Nala.
            According to Mahabharata, Nala was a great cook and he was gifted this ability by none
            other than Yama.
            According to ancient Indian lore, Nala was a cook in the kitchen of king Rituparna</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('Biryanirakhshak/image3.png')"></div>
        <p>Pākadarpaṇa was composed by King Nala according to the book itself and Indian
            tradition.
            It describes preparation of मांसौदन which is an early form of Biryani.
            First, the author describes preparation of boiled rice. He then adds meat, spices and
            even flowers for decoration</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('Biryanirakhshak/image4.png')"></div>
        <p>The author then describes the preparation of मांसौदन which is an early form of Biryani.
            The author describes the process of rinsing, soaking rice and then draining rice.
            He then describes cutting meat to the size of rice. Ghee and coconut milk was also
            added along with Ketaki</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('Biryanirakhshak/image5.png')"></div>
        <p>For the sake of fragrance, Kasturi and Karpura (musk and camphor) was also added.
            Then the vessel was closed with upper lid, kept on fire and mixed well until it becomes
            soft.
            Then , मांसौदन was served for eating.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('Biryanirakhshak/image6.png')"></div>
        <p>This marination technique is literally what is followed in the preparation of Dum
            Biryani. How exactly have Mughals brought anything?
            The author furthers adds that the ideal मांसौदन (early form of Biryani) has to be ��चकरं
            (tasty), वृ�यं (stimulating) प�यं (wholesome) &amp; light</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('Biryanirakhshak/image7.png')"></div>
        <p>Further, Pakadarpana describes preparation of मांसौदन using the meat of quail bird.
            It uses spices, meat, ghee, aromatic substances and marination technique.
            It also recommends layering/topping</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('Biryanirakhshak/image8.png')"></div>
        <p>Pakadarpana describes the preparation of कु �ु ट मांसौदन (an early form of chicken
            Biryani).
            Using Chicken meat, salt &amp; spices, he chops meat to the size and cooks it with
            Ghee. He soaks it &amp; adds Asafoetida. He closes upper lid, keeps on fire
            &amp;mixes well until it becomes soft.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('Biryanirakhshak/image9.png')"></div>
        <p>Further Pakadarpana recommends adding "Masala powder" which should be made of
            six materials(षट्-चूण�) and he also recommends Kevada petals for fragrance (instead of
            Gulabi rose petals) . He recommends "kheema like" cutting of meat. He recommends
            enclosing the dish using आटा</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('Biryanirakhshak/image10.png')"></div>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('Biryanirakhshak/image11.png')"></div>
        <p>How exactly have Mughals brought to Biryani to India?
            Before an ignoramus says "Where are potatoes, tomatoes and Chilles?"
            There were NO potatoes, tomatoes and Chillies in the Mughalai Biryani of Shah Jahan
            &amp; Aurangzeb. There is no mention of them in Nuskha I Shahjahani Biryan
            Coming to the Mughal Biryani, we have already mentioned that the word Biryani
            originally comes from a Sanskrit word borrowed by Persian.
            The word "Biryani" DOES NOT appear until 17th century. It is ABSENT in all the older
            records.
            Ain I Akbari (16th century) describes the preparation of a dish known as Zard Birinj
            (yellow rice) which could be seen as a Mughal precursor to Mughal Biryani</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('Biryanirakhshak/image12.png')"></div>
        <p>In fact, the word 'Zard Birinj" is a straight translation of "Haridranna".
            Sanskrit हा�र� (haridra) means "Yellow". In Persian, Zard (زرد) means "Yellow". "Anna"
            generally means rice in Sanskrit and "Birinj" is rice in Persian.
            By straight translation, Zard Birinj= Haridranna</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('Biryanirakhshak/image13.png')"></div>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('Biryanirakhshak/image14.png')"></div>
        <p>The FIRST unambiguous mention of Biryani comes from Nuskha-i-Shahjahani in 17th
            century.
            t was made in the kitchens of INDIA which have access to spices. This is NOT
            surprising. Biryani IS MADE OF rice and spices which could be found only in India (or
            South East Asia)
            Now I examine the claim that "Mughals brought Biryani to India" with textual sources.
            In this respect, data from Baburnama is extremely valuable as a contemporary Mughal
            source for geographical and botanical data.
            To begin with, What was India ('Hindustan') during those days?
            In Baburnama, Hindustan begins from the East of Kabul.
            When Mughal emperor Babur reached Lamghan (Laghman), Ningnahar (Nangarhar)
            and Adinapur (Jalalabad) which are towns to east of Kabul in today's Northeast
            Afghanistan, Babur declared that he reached the border of Hindustan</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('Biryanirakhshak/image15.png')"></div>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('Biryanirakhshak/image16.png')"></div>
        <p>"Other grounds, other trees, other animals, other manners &amp; customs" is how
            Babur describes difference between Hindustan and Central Asia.
            The North/West of Kabul was known as "Khurasan" &amp; wasn't part of Hindustan.
            Kabul &amp; Qandahar were entrepots between Hindustan and Khurasan</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('Biryanirakhshak/image17.png')"></div>
        <p>With this background in place, let us examine the evidence from Babur's mouth.
            Throughout Baburnama, Babur DOES NOT mention rice when he was in Central Asia.
            He mentions other crops and cereals but rice is completely ABSENT.
            What to say of Biryani?
            The FIRST mention of rice farming in Baburnama occurs AFTER Babur enters
            Hindustan.
            He mentions that good crops of rice and corn were cultivated in Nangarhar, a place
            which Babur describes as "borderland of Hindustan"</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('Biryanirakhshak/image18.png')"></div>
        <p>Next, we are told that Rice was grown on "steep terraces" in the Nur valley of Laghman
            (today's Northeast Afghanistan) in the Hindukush mountains, which was again
            considered a part of Hindustan.
            Today, these regions are Afghan Pak borderlands</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('Biryanirakhshak/image19.png')"></div>
        <p>Then, the Mughal army conducted a night raid and looted rice fields of "Mil Kafirs".
            These were the Nuristani and Chitrali Kalash Kafirs of Hindukush mountains. They put
            up a brave resistance and fought the Mughal army</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('Biryanirakhshak/image20.png')"></div>
        <p>It is clear that Mughals DID NOT bring Biryani to India. Far from it. They did not even
            have natively cultivated rice. Rice could not be adequately grown in their homelands in
            those days. They encountered rice fields in Hindustan and looted those rice fields
            during night raids <br><br>
            While there have been occasional instances of mention of rice in central Asia( for ex,
            pilaf encountered by Alexander and rice cultivation of Kushans), this was largely the
            case of elites borrowing from South Asia or introducing an exotic crop
            At any rate, there is NOT A SINGLE mention of the word Biryani in Persia or central
            Asia. <br><br>
            The earliest mention of the word Biryani comes from 17th century and it comes from
            the kitchens of India. There is no evidence that it was brought from Persia or central
            Asia. Far from it.<br><br>
            To all the idiotic Namazees quoting this thread without understanding basic context.
            Hindavi Laziz was not a word used by Hindus. Hindus called it मांसौदन.
            Muzlim ancestors and Mughals called it Hindavi Laziz. Which is their straight
            admission that Biryani has Indian origins
            Central Asian semi arid climate is not very conducive to the production of rice.
            A related dish is Pulav.<br><br>
            The word comes from Sanskrit Pulāka (पुलाक) meaning "boiled rice" (alternatively, it
            could also mean "shrivelled grain")
            This Sanskrit word was taken into Old Tamil and Old Telugu as "Pulakam". And the
            word gave its name very famous rice dish named Pulakam that is extant even today in
            South India (�ளக�, �లక�)
            <a href="https://agarathi.com/word/%E0%AE%AA%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%B3%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D"></a>
            While Pulakam is mainly served today as a Khichdi like rice dish, some older regional
            variants particularly used spices, saffron and accompanied it with Rayta like curd
            preparation, making it identical to what is understood by "Pulav" today
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90xiiXE6w3w"></a>
            The great Persian linguist Ali Nourai shows that a sound cluster of voiceless plosive,
            non front vowel and a liquid is simply not existent in native Persian phonology Hence,
            a word such as "Pilaw/pilaf" is simply NOT a native Persian word. It is a borrowed
            loanword into Persian
            In his path-breaking magnum opus "The Etymology dictionary of Persian", The Persian
            Linguist Dr. Ali Nourai very clearly mentions that the Persian word "Pulav/Pilaw/Pilaf"
            comes from the Sanskrit word Pulāka
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('Biryanirakhshak/image21.png')"></div>
        <p>In "Etymological Dictionary of Persian", leading Persian linguist Garnik Asatrian
            makes a very interesting point. He says the word "Pulav/Pilaw" or its ancestors are
            completely ABSENT in Old &amp; Middle Persian. It occurs in New Persian when
            Ghaznavids begin expanding into India
            This shows Pulav was really Indian.
            This thread thus very clearly establishes the Indian origin of Biryani and Pulav through
            linguistic, semantic and historical prisms.
            The reader is free to make his own opinion after reading the thread</p>
