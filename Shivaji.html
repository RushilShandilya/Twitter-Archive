        <p>Taqiyya: The art of lying and deception to
            promote a violent cult.
            In this thread, I will show you how this fraudulent
            @yusufpore lies through his teeth and deceives
            readers for his cultic promotion and fraudulently
            distorts the image of Shivaji Maharaj</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image1.PNG')"></div>
        <p>In his attempt to secularise Shivaji Maharaj,
            @yusufpore resorts to his usual policy of lies,
            fraud and deception
            He names two M Havildars from 1654-55. But
            look closer to see his deception</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image2.PNG')"></div>
        <p>All these Muzlim civil administrators were from
            the period before 1657-1658 when Shahji still had
            a say.
            But they were all removed after 1660 by Shivaji
            Maharaj
            There were 200 civil servants employed during
            Shivaji's reign.
            NOT ONE of them is Muzlim.
            The Muzlim officers who were around when
            Shahji still has a say were removed by 1660.

        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image4.PNG')"></div>
        <p>As I mentioned in my tweet, only 1 out of 10
            bodyguards of Shivaji Maharaj was Muzlim. This
            fact was mentioned in contemporary source
            Shivbharat By Kavindra Parmanand
            Screenshot (h/t @authorAneesh )</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image5.PNG')"></div>
        <p>And here he quotes another liar. They come up
            with completely random lists which do not have
            any primary source.
            Many of these names are FAKE. He mentions
            "Madari Mehtar" as one of "Muzlim commander"
            of Shivaji Maharaj.
            Let us look into his historicity</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image6.PNG')"></div>
        <p>There is NO HISTORICAL SOURCE which attests
            to existence of a Muzlim general named "Madari
            Mehtar".
            As such, the claim that Shivaji Maharaj had a
            Muzlim general named "Madari Mehtar" is
            entirely false and fraudulent
            The only mention of 'Madari Mehtar" from any
            historical source is a single undated and
            unattested letter.
            Even in this letter, Madari Mehtar was NOT a
            "Muzlim general". He was a servant who arranges
            carpets.
            Even this letter is false and full of inaccuracies.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image7.PNG')"></div>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image8.PNG')"></div>
        <p>According to the letter, Aurangzeb sent Sawai Jai
            Singh to negotiate with Shivaji.
            The fact is that Sawai Jai Singh was born 8 years
            AFFTER Shivaji Maharaj's death.
            Madari Mehtar is a figment of imagination born
            out of such a letter.
            This is the real face of fraud @yusufpore
            He mentions Daraya Sarang as a Naval Chief of
            Shivaji Maharaj.
            But forgets to mentioned that the same Daraya
            Sarang was arrested by Shivaji Maharaj for
            treachery.
            This is nothing but shameless Taqqiyabazi</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image9_1.PNG')"></div>
        <p>More lies and deception.
            He mentions Kazi Hyder as a 'Muzlim
            commander of Shivaji's military forces'.
            This is a laughable claim for two reasons</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image10.PNG')"></div>
        <p>To begin with, Kazi Haider was not even a military
            officer.
            He was a scribe. He had never served in the
            Army. He had nothing to do with Administration
            or Army.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image11.PNG')"></div>
        <p>What this fraud @yusufpore tells you: "Kazi
            Haider was an officer of Shivaji".
            What he will NOT tell you: Kazi Haider was a
            traitor who joined Aurangzeb. He was given a
            robe, 10000 rupees and 2 Hazari rank

            Khan(trans. by Jadunath Sarkar)</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image12.PNG')"></div>
        <p>More lies and speculative nonsense.
            It is only natural and common sense that the
            actual number of officers could always be higher
            than the number known to us. But the officers
            known to us are about 200. They are published in
            SPSS volume III pp.211-212</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image13.PNG')"></div>
        <p>The fact remains that Shivaji had about 200
            officers in civil administration whose names are
            known to us.
            None of them is a Muzlim. Yes, he obtain the
            services of a few Muzlim officers in Navy as they
            were very skilled in this field.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image14.PNG')"></div>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image15.PNG')"></div>
        <p>But the number given by this gang of 40%
            Muzlims in Shivaji' Maharaj's army is utterly false
            and fraudulent.
            More lies and inaccuracies
            Sidi Ambar is incorrectly mentioned in this tweet
            as Shivaji Maharaj's officer. He wasn't. He was
            infact Shahji's officer. He was DISMISSED by
            Shivaji Maharaj.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image16.PNG')"></div>
        <p>Sidi Ambar was dismissed by Shivaji Maharaj
            AFTER 1654 when he set aside his father's Adil
            Shahi Authority.
            We know the names of 200 havaldars, subadars,
            sarsubadars under Shivaji . NOT ONE of them
            after this point was a Muzlim.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image17.PNG')"></div>
        <p>Noorkhan Beg is also mentioned in this list.
            The truth is that he was dismissed and replaced
            by Yesaji Kank.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image10.PNG')"></div>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image19.PNG')"></div>
        <p>Just as I mentioned in my original tweet,
            "Out of 29 cavalry commanders, 1 was Muzlim.
            Out of 36 infantry commanders, none was
            Muzlim"
            Source: Sabhasad Bakhar (noted by Mehendale
            in his book)</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image20.PNG')"></div>
        <p>With this, I have substantiated with evidence
            every single claim in my original tweet</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image21.PNG')"></div>
        <p>But what @yusufpore presented was downright
            fraud and fakery.
            His figures and names of Muzlim officers are
            wrong. A few of the names given are different
            appellations of the same person. Many of them
            in the list are traitors who changed sides. Some
            are completely imaginary!
            Many of them are not even military officers in the
            first place. With such downright fakery, they have
            fraudulently narrate a false tale of secular Shivaji
            that is bound to be demolished even by a glance
            of primary sources.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image22_1.PNG')"></div>
        <p>Intention of such taqiyya is to appropriate Shivaji
            They lie and falsify the real history of India. By
            using their cheap, fraudulent and deceptive tricks,
            they want to appropriate Shivaji Maharaj and
            deny us our own cultural history, heritage and
            legitimacy.
            Let it be known that @yusufpore is a liar, cheat
            and downright fraud masquerading as a historian
            Someone tell him the diff between "civil
            administration" and "navy". A basic reason why
            they have been counted separately by SCSS.
            This two bit mαdrassachap has as much
            knowledge on subject as the number of hair
            follicles that exist on his bald head</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image22_1.PNG')"></div>
        <p>One must be extremely thick skinned and
            shameless to count traitors like Darya Sarang
            and Kazi Haider (people who deserted Shivaji
            Maharaj and Sambhaji to join Mughals) to count
            among "Muzlim soldiers of shivaji" for furthering
            their FAKE propaganda
            This is a lie as usual. Nowhere in my thread have
            I said Shivaji dismissed ALL Muzlim officers by
            1660. He did not. He dismissed all administrative
            Muzlim officers by 1660 but he needed some in
            army and navy.
            What to expect except lies from a Taqqiyabaz</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image21.PNG')"></div>
        <p>This third class pamphleteer uses gutter
            pamphlet like Hindu as his "source" & has the gall
            of calling others pamphleteers.
            While The Hindu selectively quotes Guruji
            Golwalkar's observations,it omits what he said in
            the next passage of same book.
            An advocation for Hindu Rashtra</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image23.PNG')"></div>
        <p>It is amazing that the people who abuse Guruji
            Golwalkar day in & day out and label him a fascist
            and what not, do not hesitate to fall at his feet if
            his words could be used to further their agenda.
            Golwalkarji was a great leader and a visionary.
            But he himself said that if (+)
            He himself said that if his a few of his words
            could not be substantiated by historical proof
            and primary source, they ought to be discarded
            without a hesitation. We see Guruji Golwalkar as
            a great visionary of modern India and not as primary source of 17th century.
            When Shivaji Maharaj's half brother Ekoji wrote
            recruited Muzlims in his army
            Shivaji wrote a letter castigating his half brother
            and comparing him to Duryodhan.
            "How could you hope to win against me with the
            help of these Turks?"
            Source: New history of Marathas by GS Sardesai</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('ShivajiAsset/image24.PNG')"></div>
        <p>He said 'Gods and goddesses have favored me
            and through their favor I was able to beat down
            the Turks"
            Shivaji Maharaj believed that Gods do not favor a
            person who recruits Muzlims in army.
            So much for "Muzlims in Shivaji's army"
            In his own letter to his half brother Ekoji, Shivaji
            Maharaj describes himself as "the kiIIer of
            wicked Turks (Muzlims)".
            And that those Muzlims could not hope to
            escape with their lives.
            So much for "Secular Shivaji and his Muzlim
            Army"
