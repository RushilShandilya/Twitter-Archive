        <h1>Unfinished Agendas of Political Islam</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>
            Nothing in Islam is random. Everything is planned.
            This didn’t happen because #NupurSharma quoted
            the Hadith. This happened because Islam keeps
            waiting for an event like this to further its goals of
            world domination.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image1.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Islam’s goal is world domination by conquest;
            and ultimately conversion of the whole world to
            Islam. This is because from Islam’s point of view,
            the whole world was a Muslim property, given to
            them by Allah, as per the Hadith. We, the non-
            Muslims usurped their lands.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image2.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Yeah, absurd as it sounds, the whole world is
            considered legally the property of Muslims,
            bestowed on them by Allah even before the Prophet
            was born. So, we, the non-Muslims, are squatting
            on Muslim lands. It is their divine right to get
            Allah-bestowed lands back.
        </p>
        <p>
            From that view, Muslims are not ‘claiming’ our
            land. They are ‘reclaiming’ it as their scriptures tell
            them. From this point of view, all non-Muslims all
            over the world are illegal squatters and it is the
            Muslims who are the legal evictors. They are just
            following law.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Prophet never crossed the boundaries of
            Arabian Peninsula. But Muslims have a ‘legal’ claim
            on Jerusalem &amp; the Dome on the Rock. The
            Hadith tells them that the Prophet, flew on Al-
            Burraque, a flying horse/mare, &amp; claimed the
            Dome by touching the land with his feet.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image3.png')"></div>
        <p>
            The idea of Waqf, the concept of Islamic land
            ownership dictates that ‘Once a Waqf, always a
            Waqf’. Just like once you become a Muslim you can
            never leave it; when a land is owned by Muslims,
            becomes ‘Waqf’, then it can never revert back to
            non-Muslims.
        </p>
        <p>
            All the lands that Islamic armies ever controlled
            are considered Waqf by all Muslims. It’s their
            divine duty to reclaim all those lands from the
            heathen. This principle adds to the original idea of
            the whole world as Waqf, adds to the zeal of
            Muslims trying to re-conquer Waqf.
        </p>
        <p>
            In that view, some of the greatest Waqfs to be
            reclaimed are India, Spain, Lebanon, Greece, Israel
            and Eastern Europe as these lands were once ruled
            by Islamic armies but which became heathen once
            again as they did not entirely convert to Islam.
        </p>
        <p>
            What is happening today in India, according to
            Islamic scriptures, is that Muslims are regaining
            their legal property. India is an unfinished agenda
            of Islam. Muslims can’t tolerate that something
            which was once a Muslim land is now ruled by
            heathens.
        </p>
        <p>
            What happened in 1947 and what is happening
            today is the reclamation of Waqf by Muslims. They
            will not stop until the whole land is Islamized, ruled
            by Muslims with all its Hindus converted to Islam.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our times this can be traced by various similar
            partition movements across the world in which
            partitions happened because Muslims denied living
            under the rule of non-Muslims and demanded
            separate country. After they got their country they
            cleansed it of all non-Muslims.
        </p>
        <p>
            And the non-Muslim country was declared as a
            secular one under the pagan or non-Muslim
            benevolence. But Muslim minorities in these
            countries never left and instead stayed to make that
            country too an Islamic Waqf.
        </p>
        <p>
            It happened between Lebanon and Syria; Greece
            and Turkey; Israel and Jordan; India and Pakistan.
            I am starting a series of threads in which I will
            analyze each case one by one to show that this is a
            global strategy of Muslims and Islam.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nothing with Islam is local &amp; incidental.
            Everything is global and planned, because the
            world is a Waqf of Muslims &amp; the goal is world
            domination. Muslims NEVER react. They always
            first ACT. But they spin narratives as if they are
            reacting to non-Muslim provocation.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will illustrate all these claims here by four
            examples one by one in the coming series. Please
            stay tuned to the daily morning updates of each
            particular case titled: Unfinished Agendas of
            Political Islam.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a gut-wrenching story of how Muslims treat
            minorities, even if it is an entire ancient nation.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image4.png')"></div>

            The first genocide of 20th century was not the
            Holocaust of Jews by the Nazis in Europe. The first
            genocide was committed by an Islamic Ottoman
            Empire from 1915-17 against the ancient Christian
            nation of Armenia killing 1.5 million Armenian
            Christians.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image5.png')"></div>
        <p>
            What is now eastern Turkey has been historically
            the homeland of Armenian Christians long before
            Islam or Turks started living in Turkey. Armenia is
            an ancient Christian Empire and arguably the first
            great Empire to accept Christianity as the State
            religion.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image6.png')"></div>
        <p>
            It follows the Armenian Orthodox Church and is
            one of the most ancient and distinct group of early
            Christian churches and communities. Their tragedy
            was that at the top of Fertile Crescent they were at
            the crossroads of great empires crossing from East
            to West.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yerevan, the Armenian capital, is one of the
            oldest inhabited cities in the world. Armenians
            used to be pagans before. And even after their
            conversion to Christianity they retained many
            pagan customs like their reverence for Mount
            Ararat, the sacred centre of Armenian culture.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image7.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Armenia regularly suffered genocides in its long
            history after Muslim Turks started spilling into
            Anatolia and what is now Turkey. After
            Islamization of neighboring countries it became
            sandwiched between Shia Islam in the east and
            Sunni Turkey in the West.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 19th century eastern Armenia came under
            Russian occupation, who oppressed them too but
            Armenian religion was safe under Russia. For
            Western Armenia, the misery continued under the
            Sunni Ottoman Empire. Anti-Christian pogroms,
            rape of Armenian women etc. continued.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1896 Ottoman Sultan Hamid II ordered mass
            massacre of Armenian Christians, killing around 3
            lakh of them. It was a precursor of the Armenian
            Genocide to come. In 1909 the Adana Massacre
            happened in which 30,000 Armenian Christians
            were brutally massacred by Turkish Muslims.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1908 Turkey had an internal political
            revolution in which a new crop of Turkish leaders
            came to rule the country. They were called ‘Young
            Turks’: famous for their ‘modern’ ideas. They were
            actually keener to ‘cleanse Turkey’ of minorities to
            create a ‘pure modern nation’.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the start of the First World War in 1914 the
            sporadic massacres of Armenian Christians were
            about to transform into a systematic genocide. The
            Armenians were accused of secretly conspiring with
            the Russian army, which was obviously a false
            charge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Facts don’t matter in a society all too willing to
            blame non-Muslims. Turkish Muslim army
            incurred military losses against Russia, but while
            retreating, they massacred Armenian Christians
            who were Turkish citizens. In this the army had full
            support of common Turkish Muslims.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mass massacres of Armenian Christians had
            started by December 1914. Turkish Muslim state
            would play death games with Armenians.
            Armenians would be asked to ‘surrender all arms’.
            If some did, they would be killed on suspicion of
            ‘conspiring against Turkey’.
        </p>
        <p>
            If they didn’t, then they were accused of
            ‘disobeying Turkish orders’ and would be killed en
            masse. Van, one of the greatest Turkish cities in the
            East, and a great center of Armenia experience
            mass killing of Armenian Christians in early 1915.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Russians arrived there in May 1915 they
            found 55,000 corpses of Armenian Christians,
            which amounted to more than half of the Van
            population before the massacre. By June 15 this
            ancient stronghold of Armenian Christians had only
            10 Christians left.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image8.png')"></div>
        <p>
            When Turkish armies entered Armenian villages
            to massacre the Christians, men would be instantly
            killed and women would be raped and kidnapped.
            Then nearby civilian Kurdish Muslims would
            converge and kidnap the Christian kids for slavery.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image9.png')"></div>
        <p>
            The Turkish Muslim organization which
            organized the genocide was called Committee of
            Union and Progress (CUP). (The cruel irony!). CUP
            hated the possibility of a post-War scenario where it
            would be forced to grant a state to Armenia in
            eastern Turkey.
        </p>
        <p>
            The solution as per the Ottoman Muslim records
            was: to reduce Armenian Christian population to
            less than 5%, in their very heartlands, where in
            many places Armenians were more than 50%! The
            State agreed that the goal could not be achieved
            without genocide.
        </p>
        <p>
            Armenian Christians in the war zone were
            simply massacred wherever they were. In the peace
            zone, the strategy was different. The peace zone
            Armenians were ordered to ‘march towards the
            Syrian desert’, for they could not be trusted during
            the war.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image10.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Where were they being marched to? To Syrian
            Desert! A less barbaric Empire might have
            pretended to send them to a promised homeland,
            but Ottoman Muslim State was the most barbaric
            the world has ever seen. There was no pretense. It
            was genocide and the Turks proudly owned it.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image12.png')"></div>
        <p>
            To occupy the homes, villages and entire towns
            vacated by Armenian Christians, the Turkish State
            came up with creative solutions. They invited
            Muslim tribes from all over the Middle East and
            Caucasus to come and take over the Armenian
            Christian homes to settle in Turkey.
        </p>

        <p>
            Muslim tribes from Caucasus like Chechens
            &amp; Circassians and Kurds from Syria answered
            the call of Turkey. Islamic hatred of the non-
            Muslims filled these civilians with unimaginable
            barbarity and they gladly assisted the Ottoman
            State in the genocide of Armenians.
        </p>
        <p>
            As if this was not enough, Ottoman Muslim
            officers appointed Muslim imams to encourage the
            migrating Muslim tribes to kill Armenian
            Christians. There were financial rewards to the
            Muslims who answered the state’s call and who
            killed Armenian Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1915 the genocide started in earnest. This
            time Ottomans wanted to save Armenian properties
            for Muslims so they were not killed in their villages.
            Instead they were marched to the desert. Men were
            separated from women and children and were shot
            first.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image13.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Execution sites of Armenian Christians were
            chosen near the highways, in rugged mountainous
            terrains and near lakes, wells, cisterns and rivers to
            conceal the bodies, and to dispose them off easily.
            The Armenian Christians were marched in convoys.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image14.png')"></div>
        <p>
            These convoys were escorted by Turkish Muslim
            gendarmes. They would ask Armenian Christians
            for ransom to escort them, fully knowing that
            scarcely anyone was capable of actually paying
            them. Those who could not pay were killed, which
            meant most of the Armenians.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image15.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Transit camps were set to control the flow of
            killings near Erzindjan. The dead bodies of
            massacred Armenians would just be dumped in the
            nearby Kemah gorge. Sometimes they would just be
            pushed off mountain cliffs. Thousands were killed
            like this near Lake Hazar.
        </p>
        <p>
            Armenian Christians were forced to march
            without food and water. And anyone who collapsed
            due to sheer exhaustion was shot instantly whether
            it was a child or a woman. Turkish highways in
            those times were lined for miles with decaying
            corpses of Armenian Christians.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image16.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Drowning Armenian Christians in lakes and
            rivers was a favorite method of the Turkish Muslim
            state. Two men were tied together back to back and
            drowned, to prevent them from swimming and to
            preserve the precious supply of resources like rope.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image17.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Lakhs were simply killed and dumped in rivers
            for a quick disposal of dead bodies. All these rivers
            merged with the mega rivers of Tigris and
            Euphrates. So many Armenian bodies floated down
            these rivers that they blocked the rivers and needed

            Thousands of these rotting corpses of Armenian
            Christians were stuck to the banks of these rivers.
            And yet so many were massacred by Turkish
            Muslims that some Armenian corpses traveled
            more than 2000 kms all through Iraq &amp; ended
            up in the Persian Gulf.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image19.png')"></div>
        <p>
            And like always a few Armenians were
            converted to Islam. Most Armenians resisted and
            thus they met such horrible fate. Anywhere where
            they were more than 5% genocide was preferred by
            the Ottomans. 99% Armenians of Erzerum were
            massacred.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image20.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Armenian women were also kidnapped and
            used as sex slaves. During the World War, a lot of
            Armenian women were sold – naked – like cattle in
            the markets of the Muslim city Damascus. Many
            were sold in Arabian markets &amp; were bought
            by Hajj pilgrims.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image21.png')"></div>
        <p>
            15 lakh Armenian Christians were massacred by
            Turkish Muslims during the two years of 1915-17,
            almost half of the entire Armenian populations.
            Only Eastern Armenia which was under Russian
            control survived such fate.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image22.png')"></div>
        <p>
            But almost entire Western Armenia was
            massacred in one of the most barbaric, horrible and
            horrifying genocides in the history of humankind.
            Even the Holocaust was not as thorough. And it was
            a ‘necessary’ act to create a ‘pure Turkish Muslim
            nation state’.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is how a Muslim power treats its non-
            Muslim minorities: with an absolute genocide. Any
            non-Muslim minority in any Muslim country can
            meet this fate anytime. Events unfolding in
            Bangladesh vis-à-vis its Hindu minorities are
            moving in similar direction.

            Greece &amp; the Balkans vs. Turkey
            How Turkey is Islamizing its former Christian
            colonies after an unequal partition while claiming
            secular character.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image23.png')"></div>
        <p>
            What is today Turkey once used to be Greece.
            Yes! This is the first geographical fact that you need
            to familiarize yourself with. Turkey was not Turkey.
            Turkey was called Anatolia/ Asia Minor during
            pagan and Christian times. While eastern Turkey
            was Armenia.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image24.png')"></div>
        <p>
            The original home of Turks is in the steppes of
            eastern Siberia, somewhere near Lake Baikal. Turks
            are invaders/ settlers in Turkey. Turks are NOT the
            original inhabitants of Turkey.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image25.png')"></div>
        <p>
            What is now Turkey was once Greece and the
            peninsula called Anatolia. Anatolia had some of the
            most important provinces of pagan Greek, pagan
            Roman and then Christian Byzantine empires. It is
            home to two of the ancient 7 wonders.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image26.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Greece was a maritime civilization and the entire
            littoral of Turkey and many inland cities were
            settled by Greece. Some of the greatest Greek cities
            like Ephesus and Smyrna are located in what is now
            Muslim Turkey.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image27.png')"></div>
        <p>
            By 5th century, what is Turkey had become
            entirely a part of Greece: Greek in culture, language
            and Christian in religion as it was part of the
            Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire then.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image28.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Starting in 11th century, barbaric tribes of Seljuk
            Turks started invading Byzantium Empire in
            Anatolia (present day Turkey). These Turks were
            Muslim. They were converted by the Arabs and
            Persians during the Muslim conquest of
            Transoxiana.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image29.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Rising from their homelands near the Aral Sea,
            these Seljuk Turks invaded the Byzantium Empire
            in Anatolia (what is now Turkey). In the great
            Battle of Manzikert in 1071, the Muslim Seljuks
            defeated the Christian Byzantine armies and
            captured Emperor Romanos IV.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image30.png')"></div>
        <p>
            This was a devastating defeat for the Christian
            Byzantine Empire. It made sure that they will not
            be able to defend Anatolia and Armenia, two of its
            richest and core territories. The Muslim Turks
            meanwhile started invading Anatolia and settling
            there in huge numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
            They displaced the local Christians, converted
            them to Islam and massacred any who resisted and
            eventually managed to convert a core part of Greek
            civilization into a Muslim majority land. Only
            Armenia in the east was able to resist a little.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Seljuk Turks had Islamized Asia Minor but
            had not been able to win the capital of Byzantine
            Empire – Constantinople. That job was completed
            by the Ottoman Empire which rose in 14th century
            as a successor of Seljuk Turks in Anatolia.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Ottomans finally invaded and destroyed
            Constantinople in 1453 and the Byzantine Empire
            finally was dead. The most important Christian city
            in the world at that time was invaded, destroyed
            and Islamized by Ottomans. It was renamed as
            Istanbul in Islamic tradition.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image31.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Ottomans expanded in other parts of Eastern
            Europe and controlled all of the Balkans including
            countries like Bulgaria, Macedonia, Serbia, Bosnia,
            Albania, parts of Croatia. It also came to rule core
            ancient pagan Greece in Peloponnese, Thessaly,
            Athens and Macedonia.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image32.png')"></div>
        <p>
            After a brutal occupation of around 300 years,
            Greece finally became independent in 1829 in a
            revolution of independence in which Greece was
            helped by Russian, France and UK. The current
            boundaries of Greece however were achieved only
            by 1923.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image33.png')"></div>
        <p>
            In the 1920 Treaty of Sevres, Greece had
            acquired most of Thrace and a toehold near the
            ancient Greek city of Smyrna in Anatolian
            mainland. This had finally given Greece a
            semblance of ancient Greek boundaries, although
            minus its capital of Constantinople.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image34.png')"></div>
        <p>
            But Turkey would not allow even that. Mustafa
            Kemal Ataturk led his army against the Greek
            protectorates of Smyrna and Thrace and threw
            Greece out of Anatolia by 1922. Turkey then
            proceeded to commit another genocide: this time
            against Greeks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Around 264,000 Greek Christians were
            massacred in genocide of the last Greek Christians
            left in Anatolia. The genocide was particularly
            severe in Black Sea regions and is known as the
            Pontic Genocide. Some of the most ancient Greek
            communities of Black Sea were no more.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the West, Greek Christians of Smyrna
            suffered genocide by Turkish Muslim army and
            civilians. Historian Arnold Toynbee tells that in
            Smyrna, the Turks not only killed the Greeks, but
            burned their homes with petrol to completely
            obliterate Christian presence in Turkey.
        </p>
        <p>
            Greek Orthodox Archbishop Chrysostomos of
            Smyrna was lynched in public. Greek Christians of
            Sivas suffered unspeakable atrocities. Greeks were
            finally destroyed in their ancient eastern homeland
            with literally no one surviving in Smyrna, Ephesus
            and all of Anatolia.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1923 a transfer of population as proposed by
            the Greek Prime Minister Venizelos. He had
            witnessed the horrible genocide of Armenians and
            Greeks. Turkey was eager for ethnic cleansing and
            accepted the proposal.
        </p>
        <p>
            An exchange of population was made between
            Turkey and the Balkans. Whatever Christians were
            left in Turkey after the genocide were immediately
            denaturalized and expelled to Greece. Greece also
            sent its Muslims to Turkey. The Partition was
            complete.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is the only case of a finished Partition, in
            which a complete exchange of population was
            made. While Greeks mostly transferred Turkish
            Muslims, Turkey responded by killing most Greek
            Christians and expelling the rest to Greece. But in
            any case, the Partition was complete.
        </p>
        <p>
            Greece, after a great human cost, had finally
            achieved a solution for the Islamic problem locally
            by transferring all Muslims to Turkey. It seemed as
            if there was a local solution to the Islamic problem.
            But here is not where the story ends.
        </p>
        <p>
            Greece today borders with four countries:
            Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Turkey. Two of
            which are completely Muslim, one is almost Muslim
            majority and the last has a sizeable Muslim
            minority waiting to invade Greece.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image35.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Although Greece exchanged all its Muslim
            population but other countries in Balkans were not
            as thorough. Albania and Kosovo were almost
            completely Muslim, while Bosnia had a large
            Muslim minority and so did north Macedonia.
            Bulgaria too had some Muslims.
        </p>
        <p>
            But Balkans came under Communist rule and
            for 70 years the religion of these countries was not
            in focus. But after the fall of communism religion
            once again became supreme and the religious
            configuration of these countries started working
            against Greek interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fall of communism led to the collapse of
            infrastructure and institutions in these countries.
            Lakhs of Bulgarians fled to Western Europe and
            other countries. And their population was in steep
            decline due to communist depression. Other
            countries were in similar situations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Turkish Muslims took advantage of this
            situation. They started infiltrating these countries
            in the 1990s, taking over their institutions and
            established Muslim majority villages, towns and
            cities in the Balkans. Bulgaria now has a huge
            Muslim population of around 12%.
        </p>
        <p>
            Macedonia is almost where Lebanon was in
            1971. It has now a Muslim minority of 33% which
            has been rapidly increasing through migration in
            the past three decades. It might soon have a
            Muslim majority.
        </p>
        <p>
            Albania is around 83% Muslim majority and
            Kosova next door is almost completely Muslim. And
            these two countries spearhead a lot of mafia and
            illegal activities in the Mediterranean region. And
            the fourth country is of course Turkey.
        </p>
        <p>
            Greece is surrounded by Muslim countries and
            heavy Muslim minorities from ALL sides. As a
            result there is once again a Muslim minority in
            Greece of around 2% and fast growing. But Turkey
            on the other hand has eliminated all of its Christian
            population forever.
        </p>
        <p>
            The recent refugee crisis in Europe has
            devastated Greece and most Arab refugees first
            enter Greece through Thrace, bypassing all of
            Turkey. And Turkey aids them in this Islamic
            invasion of Europe. Greece is the first frontline
            country in this Islamic invasion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Added to that is the sinking economy of Greece
            and its rapidly shrinking population. It is only a
            matter of time before Turkish Muslims once again
            become a significant minority in Greece.
        </p>
        <p>
            Greece teaches us that there is no local solution
            to the problem of Islamism and Islamic infiltration.
            The religious demography of the neighboring
            countries matter as much as the demography of our
            own country does. India shall take enough lessons
            from the Greek problem.</p>
        <p>
            Spain is the only country that could completely
            reverse the Islamization of the country. It threw off
            the Muslim rule; converted back all remaining
            Muslims to Christianity.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image36.png')"></div>
        <p>
            In the annals of Islamic history, Spain is one of
            the two unsuccessful endeavors of Muslim armies.
            While India is a defeat, Spain was a reversal.
            Visigothic Christian Spain came under the rule of
            Islam under the Umayyad Caliphate in as early as
            711 CE.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image37.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Reclamation of Spain and Portugal (Iberian
            Peninsula) from Islam and for Christianity is called
            the Reconquista. It started as early as 718 CE, just
            seven years after the Islamic conquest of Spain. An
            independent Christian kingdom called Asturias was
            created in north Spain.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Reconquista continued with Cordoba falling
            in 1236 CE, Seville falling in 1248 and finally the
            Muslim Kingdom of Granada in the south falling to
            Ferdinand and Isabella in 1492 CE. In a war that
            lasted for around eight centuries, Spain was re-
            conquered from Islam.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image37.png')"></div>
        <p>
            All Muslims in Spain were given two options:
            reconvert to Christianity and live in Spain; or leave
            Spain and go to any Islamic kingdom. All mosques
            were reconverted into churches and cathedrals.
            Spain’s geography, demography and landscape
            were re-conquered by Christianity.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image38.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Compared to all Islamic conquests, this was a
            very constructive way of re-conquering the sacred
            space of Spain for Christianity. Architecture which
            was created during the Islamic rule wasn’t
            destroyed, but repurposed for Christianity.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('politicalIslamAsset/image39.png')"></div>
        <p>
            That the neo-converts didn’t follow Islam in
            secret was made sure by appointing godfathers to
            every new-born. Various practices were followed by
            the Christian state to make sure Islam wasn’t
            followed by neo-converts in private. Some of them
            were harsh but necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Spain is the greatest success of Christianity in
            reclaiming a land from Islam. And it is
            consequently the greatest reversal and defeat for
            Islam. That is why there are constant attempts to
            make it an Islamic land again as it has once been
            Dar-ul-Islam (Land of Islam).
        </p>
        <p>
            What was achieved in 800 years was reversed in
            some ways in the past five decades under
            democracy and secularism. Now there are 4% of
            Muslims in Spain. This would be okay had Muslim
            countries in Africa also sported a growth of
            Christian minority.
        </p>
        <p>
            But this is not the case and all Muslim countries
            in Africa and Asia show a steady decline of non-
            Muslim populations. On the other hand, almost all
            Christian countries show a steady rise of Muslim
            populations in Europe and elsewhere. Clearly,
            Islam is growing everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            Situation is much worse than Muslim
            population of Spain shows. Spain is the entry point
            of lakhs of African Muslim emigrants to Europe.
            Many Muslims become citizens in Spain, take EU
            social benefits, take cheque once a month in Spain
            but keep living in Morocco.
        </p>
        <p>In 2004 Al-Qaeda hit Spain with deadliest
            Islamic terror attacks in Western Europe killing
            around 200 Christians in Madrid Train Bombings.
            The attack was made 3 days before elections in
            Spain and managed to sway the election to a party
            more conducive to Islamic designs.

        <p> Coupled with downward demographic trends,
            tumbling economy and pandemic woes, Spain is
            primed, just like Greece for an Islamic takeover. It
            is Islam’s greatest unfinished agenda. Spain shows
            us that there is no local solution to Islamic
            conquest.

        <p>
            “Islam has bloody borders”, as Samuel
            Huntington said. Everywhere in the world, the
            Muslims have difficulty living with their non-
            Muslim neighbors, whether they are in majority or
            minority. To sum up, Islam has different strategies
            depending on different demography.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Muslims are in majority (Egypt, Pakistan,
            Bangladesh) they keep converting &amp; killing
            non-Muslim minorities, citing conspiracy theories
            &amp; disloyalty. Repeated massacres &amp;
            genocides of non-Muslims go unnoticed and
            unreported until there are no non-Muslims left.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Muslims are a huge minority, they call for
            a Civil War, citing victimhood (but always drawing
            first blood), like in Lebanon, &amp; in the noise of
            war they kill &amp; threaten patches of majority,
            who flee the country in fear, changing demography
            to Muslim majority.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Muslims are in minority, they call for a
            separate State, like India, Myanmar or Thailand
            where they reserve one part of the country for
            Islam, making it a pure Islamic land and proceed to
            carve another chunk out of the democratic, secular,
            non-Muslim country.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ultimate goal of Islam is world conquest, for
            Qayamat (Judgment) won’t arrive until every single
            person in this world is Muslim and that is why
            “Islam has bloody borders.” We should keep that in
            mind while planning ‘co-existence’.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tomorrow we will have a pictorial journey
            through the lives of Islamic kingdoms and how they
            treated the defeated non-Muslims societies,
            particularly women.
