            Unfinished Agendas of Political Islam – Case 3 –
            Greece &amp; the Balkans vs. Turkey
            How Turkey is Islamizing its former Christian
            colonies after an unequal partition while claiming
            secular character.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('GreeceTurkeyAsset/image1.png')"></div>
        <p>
            2. What is today Turkey once used to be Greece.
            Yes! This is the first geographical fact that you need
            to familiarize yourself with. Turkey was not Turkey.
            Turkey was called Anatolia/ Asia Minor during
            pagan and Christian times. While eastern Turkey
            was Armenia.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('GreeceTurkeyAsset/image2.png')"></div>
        <p>
            3. The original home of Turks is in the steppes of
            eastern Siberia, somewhere near Lake Baikal. Turks
            are invaders/ settlers in Turkey. Turks are NOT the
            original inhabitants of Turkey.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('GreeceTurkeyAsset/image3.png')"></div>
        <p>
            4. What is now Turkey was once Greece and the
            peninsula called Anatolia. Anatolia had some of the
            most important provinces of pagan Greek, pagan
            Roman and then Christian Byzantine empires. It is
            home to two of the ancient 7 wonders.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('GreeceTurkeyAsset/image4.png')"></div>
        <p>
            5. Greece was a maritime civilization and the entire
            littoral of Turkey and many inland cities were
            settled by Greece. Some of the greatest Greek cities
            like Ephesus and Smyrna are located in what is now
            Muslim Turkey.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('GreeceTurkeyAsset/image5.png')"></div>
        <p>
            6. By 5th century, what is Turkey had become
            entirely a part of Greece: Greek in culture, language
            and Christian in religion as it was part of the
            Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire then.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('GreeceTurkeyAsset/image6.png')"></div>
        <p>
            7. Starting in 11th century, barbaric tribes of Seljuk
            Turks started invading Byzantium Empire in
            Anatolia (present day Turkey). These Turks were
            Muslim. They were converted by the Arabs and
            Persians during the Muslim conquest of
            Transoxiana.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('GreeceTurkeyAsset/image7.png')"></div>
        <p>
            8. Rising from their homelands near the Aral Sea,
            these Seljuk Turks invaded the Byzantium Empire
            in Anatolia (what is now Turkey). In the great
            Battle of Manzikert in 1071, the Muslim Seljuks
            defeated the Christian Byzantine armies and
            captured Emperor Romanos IV.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('GreeceTurkeyAsset/image8.png')"></div>
        <p>
            9. This was a devastating defeat for the Christian
            Byzantine Empire. It made sure that they will not
            be able to defend Anatolia and Armenia, two of its
            richest and core territories. The Muslim Turks
            meanwhile started invading Anatolia and settling
            there in huge numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
            10. They displaced the local Christians, converted
            them to Islam and massacred any who resisted and
            eventually managed to convert a core part of Greek
            civilization into a Muslim majority land. Only
            Armenia in the east was able to resist a little.
        </p>
        <p>
            11. The Seljuk Turks had Islamized Asia Minor but
            had not been able to win the capital of Byzantine
            Empire – Constantinople. That job was completed
            by the Ottoman Empire which rose in 14th century
            as a successor of Seljuk Turks in Anatolia.
        </p>
        <p>
            12. The Ottomans finally invaded and destroyed
            Constantinople in 1453 and the Byzantine Empire
            finally was dead. The most important Christian city
            in the world at that time was invaded, destroyed
            and Islamized by Ottomans. It was renamed as
            Istanbul in Islamic tradition.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('GreeceTurkeyAsset/image9.png')"></div>
        <p>
            13. Ottomans expanded in other parts of Eastern
            Europe and controlled all of the Balkans including
            countries like Bulgaria, Macedonia, Serbia, Bosnia,
            Albania, parts of Croatia. It also came to rule core
            ancient pagan Greece in Peloponnese, Thessaly,
            Athens and Macedonia.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('GreeceTurkeyAsset/image10.png')"></div>
        <p>
            14. After a brutal occupation of around 300 years,
            Greece finally became independent in 1829 in a
            revolution of independence in which Greece was
            helped by Russian, France and UK. The current
            boundaries of Greece however were achieved only
            by 1923.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('GreeceTurkeyAsset/image11.png')"></div>
        <p>
            15. In the 1920 Treaty of Sevres, Greece had
            acquired most of Thrace and a toehold near the
            ancient Greek city of Smyrna in Anatolian
            mainland. This had finally given Greece a
            semblance of ancient Greek boundaries, although
            minus its capital of Constantinople.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('GreeceTurkeyAsset/image12.png')"></div>
        <p>
            16. But Turkey would not allow even that. Mustafa
            Kemal Ataturk led his army against the Greek
            protectorates of Smyrna and Thrace and threw
            Greece out of Anatolia by 1922. Turkey then
            proceeded to commit another genocide: this time
            against Greeks.
        </p>
        <p>
            17. Around 264,000 Greek Christians were
            massacred in genocide of the last Greek Christians
            left in Anatolia. The genocide was particularly
            severe in Black Sea regions and is known as the
            Pontic Genocide. Some of the most ancient Greek
            communities of Black Sea were no more.
        </p>
        <p>
            18. In the West, Greek Christians of Smyrna
            suffered genocide by Turkish Muslim army and
            civilians. Historian Arnold Toynbee tells that in
            Smyrna, the Turks not only killed the Greeks, but
            burned their homes with petrol to completely
            obliterate Christian presence in Turkey.
        </p>
        <p>
            19. Greek Orthodox Archbishop Chrysostomos of
            Smyrna was lynched in public. Greek Christians of
            Sivas suffered unspeakable atrocities. Greeks were
            finally destroyed in their ancient eastern homeland
            with literally no one surviving in Smyrna, Ephesus
            and all of Anatolia.
        </p>
        <p>
            20. In 1923 a transfer of population as proposed by
            the Greek Prime Minister Venizelos. He had
            witnessed the horrible genocide of Armenians and
            Greeks. Turkey was eager for ethnic cleansing and
            accepted the proposal.
        </p>
        <p>
            21. An exchange of population was made between
            Turkey and the Balkans. Whatever Christians were
            left in Turkey after the genocide were immediately
            denaturalized and expelled to Greece. Greece also
            sent its Muslims to Turkey. The Partition was
            complete.
        </p>
        <p>
            22. It is the only case of a finished Partition, in
            which a complete exchange of population was
            made. While Greeks mostly transferred Turkish
            Muslims, Turkey responded by killing most Greek
            Christians and expelling the rest to Greece. But in
            any case, the Partition was complete.
        </p>
        <p>
            23. Greece, after a great human cost, had finally
            achieved a solution for the Islamic problem locally
            by transferring all Muslims to Turkey. It seemed as
            if there was a local solution to the Islamic problem.
            But here is not where the story ends.
        </p>
        <p>
            24. Greece today borders with four countries:
            Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Turkey. Two of
            which are completely Muslim, one is almost Muslim
            majority and the last has a sizeable Muslim
            minority waiting to invade Greece.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('GreeceTurkeyAsset/image13.png')"></div>
        <p>
            25. Although Greece exchanged all its Muslim
            population but other countries in Balkans were not
            as thorough. Albania and Kosovo were almost
            completely Muslim, while Bosnia had a large
            Muslim minority and so did north Macedonia.
            Bulgaria too had some Muslims.
        </p>
        <p>
            26. But Balkans came under Communist rule and
            for 70 years the religion of these countries was not
            in focus. But after the fall of communism religion
            once again became supreme and the religious
            configuration of these countries started working
            against Greek interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            27. Fall of communism led to the collapse of
            infrastructure and institutions in these countries.
            Lakhs of Bulgarians fled to Western Europe and
            other countries. And their population was in steep
            decline due to communist depression. Other
            countries were in similar situations.
        </p>
        <p>
            28. Turkish Muslims took advantage of this
            situation. They started infiltrating these countries
            in the 1990s, taking over their institutions and
            established Muslim majority villages, towns and
            cities in the Balkans. Bulgaria now has a huge
            Muslim population of around 12%.
        </p>
        <p>
            29. Macedonia is almost where Lebanon was in
            1971. It has now a Muslim minority of 33% which
            has been rapidly increasing through migration in
            the past three decades. It might soon have a
            Muslim majority.
        </p>
        <p>
            30. Albania is around 83% Muslim majority and
            Kosova next door is almost completely Muslim. And
            these two countries spearhead a lot of mafia and
            illegal activities in the Mediterranean region. And
            the fourth country is of course Turkey.
        </p>
        <p>
            31. Greece is surrounded by Muslim countries and
            heavy Muslim minorities from ALL sides. As a
            result there is once again a Muslim minority in
            Greece of around 2% and fast growing. But Turkey
            on the other hand has eliminated all of its Christian
            population forever.
        </p>
        <p>
            32. The recent refugee crisis in Europe has
            devastated Greece and most Arab refugees first
            enter Greece through Thrace, bypassing all of
            Turkey. And Turkey aids them in this Islamic
            invasion of Europe. Greece is the first frontline
            country in this Islamic invasion.
        </p>
        <p>
            33. Added to that is the sinking economy of Greece
            and its rapidly shrinking population. It is only a
            matter of time before Turkish Muslims once again
            become a significant minority in Greece.
        </p>
        <p>
            34. Greece teaches us that there is no local solution
            to the problem of Islamism and Islamic infiltration.
            The religious demography of the neighboring
            countries matter as much as the demography of our
            own country does. India shall take enough lessons
            from the Greek problem.</p>
