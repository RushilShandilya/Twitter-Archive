            Any idea which is 1400 hundred years long has to
            be understood only in long civilizational arcs. Just
            as India is a civilizational nation, Islam is a
            civilizational force and has to be understood in
            those long terms.

        <p>
            Muslims are fond of saying that “Islam has never
            lost.” Sadly, except in one case, this is true. But
            what does that mean? That Islamic armies never
            lost? That the enemies never won against them in
            battlefield? That they never had bad years or
            decades? No. It is not like this.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image2.png')"></div>
        <p>
            After the initial burst out of Arabia after the
            death of the Prophet the Islamic armies reached
            India’s gates in the East and knocked at Europe’s
            doors in Spain in the West. This happened because
            two great empires of those times almost instantly
            fell against Islam.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image3.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Persia, one of the greatest empires of the time,
            fell within a matter of 20 years. The Sassanids
            ruling Persia were tired with their constant wars
            with the Byzantium empire. In just 20 years the
            empire was gone, Zoroastrianism declining and
            Persia was converting to Islam.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image4.png')"></div>
        <p>
            One thing to focus here: Islamic armies never
            stopped at political, economic and social victory.
            For them a victory was not victory until it was also
            religious. So conversions ALWAYS had to follow.
            This they achieved in many ways.
        </p>
        <p>
            Forced conversions at the point of the sword.
            Implementing Jizyah tax – which was the tax of
            being non-Muslim under Islam. You could stay
            non-Muslim only by paying a great Jizyah tax
            which was sometimes as much as 75%. This decided
            that most would eventually convert.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image5.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Conversions were the most sacred duty of a
            Muslim. It was the point of Jihad, to bring the light
            of Islam to all heathens. They could choose death,
            conversion to Islam or Jizyah, which would earn
            Islam a lot &amp; eventually lead to conversion of
            the subject population.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once in, there was no way out. You could enter
            Islam, but you could never leave Islam. Punishment
            for leaving Islam was death. This is very important.
            In this way Islam ONLY ALWAYS GREW. Its
            graph, even when slow would never go down. It had
            various other implications.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image6.png')"></div>
        <p>
            This law of ‘Always In, Never Out’ meant that
            while the opponents of Islam need to keep winning
            repeatedly and endlessly until Islam is gone, Islam
            only needed to win once. Because after winning
            once they would convert opponents to Islam. And
            the outsider would become insider.
        </p>
        <p>
            This had a profound implication on the history
            of the world. This ensured that while non-Muslims
            needed to win eternally, Islam needed to win only
            once; so the Muslims just had to keep trying; and
            once they won they would convert the defeated to
            Islam, forever.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image7.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Once the defeated society was converted they
            became a part of Islam and started attacking others
            with the same or more zeal. Once defeated, they
            would become the ambassadors and soldiers of
            Islam. This is how Arabs, then Persians, then Turks
            spread Islam.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image8.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Near Persia, in the West, there was Byzantium.
            Just like Persia, Byzantium also lost spectacularly
            to Islamic armies but unlike Persia it didn’t lose its
            capital Constantinople. But the way to the West was
            open.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image9.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Islam reached Spain by traversing the African
            Mediterranean coast. Except former Egyptian
            territories there were no other major countries on
            the way. This further helped Islam as it completely
            managed to change their religion, culture as well as
            language.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image10.png')"></div>
        <p>
            After the initial six or seven decades of an
            unprecedented expansion by Islamic armies, its
            success halted at the gates of India which it could
            not penetrate. The question comes now: these
            armies must also have been defeated sometime. Did
            Islam lose then? No it did not.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Islamic armies ruled non-Muslim
            populations it was the non-Muslims populations
            who converted to Islam. But what happened when
            non-Muslim kings ruled Islamic populations? Did
            the non-Muslim pagans also convert Muslims back
            to paganism? It turns out no.
        </p>
        <p>
            The classic case is the utter defeat and
            destruction of the Abbassid Islamic Caliphate by
            the Mongols in the Siege of Baghdad by Hulagu
            Khan in 1258 CE. Hulagu utterly destroyed the
            Abbassid Caliphate once and forever and made a
            genocide of Muslims in Baghdad.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image11.png')"></div>
        <p>
            It was the first dusk of Islamic power. Arabs and
            Persians were spent and a pagan-Buddhist Turco-
            Mongol power had completely destroyed their
            political and military power. But did that affect
            Islam badly in the long run? Not at all. It actually
            benefitted them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hulagu Khan (Khan is a pagan title) was a
            pagan-Buddhist, but like most pagans he respected
            others’ ‘religions’, failing to recognize that Islam
            was not just another religion. It was a religion
            which wanted to end all religions.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image12.png')"></div>
        <p>
            So Hulagu Khan never tried to convert Muslims.
            Instead he gave them full freedom to practice their
            religion. So even while Islamic armies lost, and
            Muslims were killed en masse, Islam didn’t lose as
            the religious configuration of the Empire remained
            completely Islamic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually Islam gained from Mongol
            occupation. Hulagu’s son &amp; successor, Abaqa
            Khan, was a Buddhist. But he didn't convert his
            Muslim subjects. His son Arghun Khan, the next
            ruler, was also a very devout Buddhist. But even he
            didn’t try to convert his Muslim population.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image13.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Three generations of pagan rulers of Baghdad
            didn’t try to convert their Muslim subjects. And
            remember that no Muslim ruler would ever let go of
            a single opportunity to convert his subjects to
            Islam. Islam was biding its time until tide turned in
            its favor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, Muslim Ummah was constantly
            converting the Mongol court one by one to Islam:
            mostly saying that it will help the Mongol rulers
            rule Muslims if they followed Islam and once they
            did, exclusion of other faiths would follow. And
            Islam would become exclusive.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image14.png')"></div>
        <p>
            In typical pagan indifference and ignorance
            none of these Islamist machinations and change in
            demography of the Mongol court affected Arghun
            Khan. Arghun was a devout Buddhist but he never
            thought that Muslims should convert to Buddhism.
            Islam was biding its time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Islam’s time came when Arghun’s son Ghazan
            became the fourth major emperor of the Ill
            Khanate. Ghazan was pushed by Ibn Taymiyyah,
            one of the most intolerant, icnonoclastic and also
            the greatest Islamic scholars of the time to become
            Muslim. And he did.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('jizyahAsset/image15.png')"></div>
        <p>
            In the prospect of expanding his empire and not
            having his Muslim subjects rebel against him, he
            turned Muslim. And ISLAM FINALLY WON. In
            this case, the Muslim subjects managed to convert a
            non-Muslim emperor after four generations of non-
            Muslim rulers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Islam wins when a Muslim army defeats a non-
            Muslim country: as the Muslim kings convert non-
            Muslims. Islam wins when a non-Muslim army
            defeats a Muslim country: as the Muslim
            population converts the non-Muslim king. And
            Islam wins in both cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Needless to say again, Islam only needs to win
            once. Iran, the successor of Ill Khanate, is still a
            100% Muslim country. They never allowed any
            other religion to grow on their land.
        </p>
        <p>
            So yes, the Islamic armies lose. Yes, their
            kingdoms and countries sometimes collaborate
            tactically with non-Muslim empires but always with
            the eye that Islam can not lose. Muslims cannot
            leave Islam. And non-Muslims should always be
            forced, appeased into Islam.
        </p>
        <p>
            They make temporary alliances with the pagans,
            heathens and non-Muslims and they have a judicial
            allowance for that and they call it Taqiyya (devout
            deception). They collaborate only so that in future
            they can convert the heathen.
        </p>
        <p>
            In short, Islam only needs to win once. While
            non-Muslims need to keep winning forever if they
            want to stop Islam. This situation can change only
            when non-Muslims also seek to convert Muslims
            whenever the situation is favorable.
