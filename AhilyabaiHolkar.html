            Today is Jayanti of Ahilyabai Holkar <br><br>
            She was a widow who became Malwa's greatest queen. Defended
            our country &amp; personally led armies into battle.Never
            plundered anyone. Developed Malwa into a prosperous kingdom.
            Rebuilt temples destroyed by Mughals. Built Dharmashalas at
            Tirthas
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image1.png')"></div>
        <p>Unfortunately, her memory has been blemished by inaccurate
            representations in modern popular media. <br><br>
            The serial "Punyashlok Ahilyabai" depicts her as ultra secularist
            feminazi icon who questions Hindu rituals &amp; Pandits while
            patronising Sufis. <br><br>
            This is far from historical truth!</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image2.png')"></div>
        <p>Ahilyabai was born on May 31 1725 to Patil Mankoji Shinde. <br><br>
            She was from Dhangar clan(classified as OBC today). While
            Dhangars were traditionally into herding, they took up arms
            &amp; held several military /civil roles in various eras of
            history(especially during Maratha resurgence)</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image3.png')"></div>
        <p>In 1737, when she was 12, Ahilyabai Holkar was married to
            Khanderao , son of Subedar Malhar Rao Holkar. <br><br>
            By the time she was married, fortunes of Holkar family had
            already waxed. <br><br>
            Malhar Rao was a Subedar of territory comprising 30 Parganas
            yielding a revenue of at least 7 Lakh</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image4.png')"></div>
        <p>In 1741, when Ahilyabai was newly married, her father -in-law
            Malhar Rao Built Indore palace &amp; ordered the kanungo to
            populate the settlement with a promise of protection to traders. <br><br>
            This began rise of Indore from its background as modest trading
            town Indrapuri to a great city</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image5.png')"></div>
        <p>While her father and father in law were frequently away to lead the
            northern campaigns of Maratha empire, it was Ahilyabai Holkar
            who ran the administration of Indore. <br><br>
            She had already become extremely popular due to her policy of
            mercy and justice towards people. <br><br>
            On 24th March 1754, when Ahilyabai was only 29, her husband
            Khanderao Holkar passed away in the siege of Kumher
            (Bharatpur) when a cannon accidently hit him. <br>
            The siege failed. The great Jat Maharaja Suraj Mal even
            constructed Samadhi for his opponent. But Ahilyabai became a
            widow
            Ahilyabai had given up all desires of life and decided to perform
            Sati to accompany her husband at his funeral pyre. <br><br>
            People requested her not to commit Sati. <br><br>
            But she said
            " He pledged to accompany me life long. Now he has left midway.
            Hence, it is proper for me to commit Sati"
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image6.png')"></div>
        <p>When she had made up her mind to perform Sati and was not
            relenting one bit, it was finally her father-in- law Malhar Rao
            Holkar who made fervent emotional appeals to stop her <br><br>
            He said <br><br>
            "Daughter, my son left me. If you leave me too, I will be without
            support. Let me die first"</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image7.png')"></div>
        <p>Malhar Rao Holkar finally burst into tears and fell at the feet of his
            daughter in law Ahilyabai Holkar. <br><br>
            This fervent appeal forced Ahilyabai to give up her decision of
            committing Sati.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image8.png')"></div>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image9.png')"></div>
        <p>After the death of her husband, Ahilyabai Holkar was groomed by
            Malhar Rao both in Military and diplomatic affairs. <br><br>
            This letter in 1765 from Malhar Rao addressed to Ahilyabai throws
            light on the situation. He sends her on a military expedition to
            Gwalior with big artillery</p>

        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image10.png')"></div>
        <p>This letter clearly shows not only that Ahilyabai was military
            trained, she was also considered capable enough to run civil
            &amp; military affairs. <br><br>
            This is a fitting testament that a woman from a humble origins
            could run important departments of the state in premodern Hindu
            India</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image10.png')"></div>
        <p>When Abdali invaded India again in 1765, Malhar Rao was fighting
            the Abdali-Rohilla army in Delhi. <br><br>
            During the same time, Ahilyabai Holkar captured Gohad fort (near
            Gwalior). Malhar Rao in his letter instructed her to "manufacture
            gun balls and balls of smaller size".</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image11.png')"></div>
        <p>While Malhar Rao was embarking on northern campaigns, it was
            Ahilyabai who secured the rule of Holkars in Madhya Pradesh
            region. <br><br>
            Malhar Rao's letters clearly show it was Ahilyabai who captured
            Gwalior and secured it for Holkar kingdom. <br><br>
            Ahilyabai's strength was her artillery.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image12.png')"></div>
        <p>Malhar Rao passed away in 1766. <br><br>
            Ahilyabai's son Maloji then became Governor. He was distressed
            at the loss of his grandfather &amp; unprepared. <br><br>
            Ahilyabai sent a very hearty &amp; inspirational letter urging her
            son not to think of past &amp; direct his thoughts to management
            of state</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image13.png')"></div>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image14.png')"></div>
        <p>Unfortunately, died within 8 months. <br><br>
            Then, rather than adopt an heir, Ahilyabai petitioned the Peshwa
            to rule the Holkar lands herself. <br><br>
            Ahilyabai already had an established record of military &amp; civil
            competence. <br><br>
            She was now the defacto Holkar ruling queen of Maheshwar</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image15.png')"></div>

        <p>On becoming ruler, Ahilyabai exercised her policy of justice and
            reconciliation. <br><br>
            She pardoned rebel Chandrawat chiefs and granted them 31
            villages. But they rebelled again. She crushed them militarily,
            forced a treaty &amp; punished the rebel chiefs. Complete victory
            was secured. <br><br>
            The fame of her arms spread far and wide.
            However, even after crushing the Chandrawats, she chose to stick
            to her policy of mercy &amp; pardon. Once again, she forgave and
            reinstated the Chandrawat chief and a dress of honor was given to
            him. <br><br>
            The Chandrawats did not rebel again</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image16.png')"></div>
        <p>Ahilyabai's reign was famed for justice not only towards her own
            people but also her rivals. <br><br>
            She frequently wrote letters asking about the welfare of women
            and children of rival chiefs who were imprisoned in jail. <br><br>
            She made sure the prisoners received adequate amount of food.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image17.png')"></div>
        <p>When a farmer collecting taxes from the villages was robbed of all
            money, the merciful queen Ahilyabai instead paid the money to
            them from her own expenses instead of punishing them. <br><br>
            Such a benevolent gesture is hardly with a parallel in those days of
            loot, plunder and mayhem.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image18.png')"></div>
        <p>The name of Ahilyabai had become a byword for honesty and
            Kindness. <br><br>
            While she worked hard to run the affairs of the state, she never
            burdened people. <br><br>
            When a specific year did not witness much rain,she did not tax her
            farmers even a penny. <br><br>
            People saw Rajmata as their own mother <br><br>
            Personally, Ahilyabai Holkar led an extremely simple and religious
            life. <br><br>
            Her "palace" is shockingly modest &amp; simple <br><br>
            She used to live in a small residence in Maheshwar. She never
            built anything for herself. <br><br>
            Her "throne" was just a simple chair &amp; did not have a single
            ornament</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image19.png')"></div>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image20.png')"></div>
        <p>Ahilyabai rose at 5 AM everyday for her Puja. <br><br>
            She then heard the recitation of Puranas and donated to brahmins
            before consuming breakfast. <br><br>
            She forsake non-veg food, onion and garlic. <br><br>
            Except during durbar, she never sat on throne. <br><br>
            She wore plain white and slept on the floor</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image21.png')"></div>
        <p>Ahilyabai's greatest contribution to Indian civilization is
            rebuilding Hindu temples &amp; tirthas that were destroyed
            during Islamic conquests and rule. <br><br>
            Without her, ALL Tirthas would have been in ruins and there
            wouldn't be any standing temple. <br><br>
            Map showing temples built by her</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image22.png')"></div>
        <p>Ahilyabai visited Somnath and was moved by the sight of
            destroyed temple with mosque built on top of it. <br><br>
            She constructed Somnath Mahadev Mandir opposite the
            (erstwhile) mosque and installed the Linga there. <br><br>
            Many Hindus believe this temple houses the original Somnath
            Jyotirlinga</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image24.png')"></div>
        <p>She visited Srisailam which was then in the domain of Nizam. The
            temple had been destroyed and lying in ruins. <br><br>
            She rebuilt temple &amp; constructed Pushkarini. <br><br>
            Wherever possible, Ahilyabai honored local tradition and built the
            temple according to regional style and custom</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image25.png')"></div>
        <p>The original Omkareshwar temple was destroyed during Tughlaq
            Invasion. <br><br>
            The present temple at Omkareshwar was built by Ahilyabai
            Holkar. She also presented the silver murti</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image26.png')"></div>
        <p>During those days of Nizam, The Mallikarjuna temple at Srisailam
            was destroyed in a very pitiable condition. It is one of the
            Jyotirlingas <br><br>
            Here is the letter from Maratha ambassador requesting the
            intervention of Ahilyabai Holkar to rebuild the temple and
            construct repair works</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image27.png')"></div>
        <p>The Aundha Nagnath Jyotirlinga, destroyed during Aurangzeb's
            conquests, was rebuilt by Ahilyabai Holkar. <br><br>
            The present standing temple was built by her</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image28.png')"></div>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image29.png')"></div>
        <p>After Aurangzeb destroyed the original Vishnvanath temple and
            built Gyanvapi Mosque on top of it <br><br>
            It was Ahilyabai who constructed the current temple of Kashi
            Vishvanath right next to mosque. <br><br>
            It is all thanks to Ahilyabai Holkar that Hindus can still worship at
            Kashi Vishnvanath</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image30.png')"></div>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image31.png')"></div>
        <p>Manikarnika Ghat was destroyed during the Mughal age. <br><br>
            The present Manikarnika Ghat with its temples was built by
            Ahilyabai Holkar</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image32.png')"></div>
        <p>To the left of manikarnika is the Tarakeshwara temple. <br><br>
            The Taraka linga is intalled in this temple. It is believe that Shiva
            here chants Taraka mantra in the ear of departed which leadrrs to
            liberation. <br><br>
            The present Tarakeshwara temple was built by Ahilyabai Holkar</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image33.png')"></div>
        <p>She also built the Kevalagiri(Ahilya) Ghat and constructed
            Brahmapuri which housed and provided free food and residence
            for thousands of Brahmins, Sannyasis and pilgrims. <br><br>
            Inside Brahmapuri she built Annapurna temple where 24*7
            Annadana (even at night) was provided to pilgrims.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image34.png')"></div>
        <p>The Kushavarta Kund at Triyambakeshvara Jyotirlinga (Nasik)
            was built by none other than Ahilyabai Holkar</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image35.png')"></div>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image36.png')"></div>
        <p>The Grishneshwara Jyotirlinga temple of Ellora was destroyed by
            Khiljis. <br><br>
            It was rebuilt by Ahilyabai Holkar. <br><br>
            Today, most tourist to Ellora caves situated less than a kilometer
            away do not even know of this temple</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image37.png')"></div>
        <p>Ahilyabai Holkar repaired the Bhimashankar Jyotirlinga temple
            and constructed a Garibkhana(alms house) there <br><br>
            It is believed by many devout Hindus that Bhimashankar linga is
            the original Lingodbhava Murti</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image38.png')"></div>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('HolkarAsset/image39.png')"></div>
        <p>Ahilyabai Holkar also rebuilt the ancient Vishnupada temple of
            Gaya. <br><br>
            It is believed by devout Hindus that this temple houses footprints
            of Vishnu. <br><br>
            After the reconstruction of this temple, Hindus were able to
            commence their shraddha and Pinda funeral rites in Gaya again</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('HolkarAsset/image40.png')"></div>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image41.png')"></div>
        <p>Ahilyabai was also a great patron of arts and crafts. <br><br>
            She promoted weaving and textiles by offering them concessions,
            advance and security. <br><br>
            The famous Maheshwari saree industry owes its origin and growth
            to her. <br><br>
            According to a tradition, the first saree was designed by her</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image42.png')"></div>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image43.png')"></div>
        <p>Ahilyabai Holkar also patronised various scholars of Vedas,
            Puranas, astronomy, astrology and medicine in her court. <br><br>
            Scholars from all over India flocked to her court where they were
            given due respect and rehabilitation. She personally crowned
            Vedic scholars &amp; washed their feet</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image44.png')"></div>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image45.png')"></div>
        <p>While the serial depicted Ahilyabai as a secularist who questions
            Hindu priests and rituals <br><br>
            Ahilyabai's own letters show that she styled herself as "Protector of
            cows and Brahmins"</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HolkarAsset/image46.png')"></div>
        <p>Ahilyabai stopped capital punishment. She instead took personal
            oath from prisoners &amp; released them. Many of the prisoners
            adopted honest life. <br><br>
