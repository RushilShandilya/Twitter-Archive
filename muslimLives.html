            1. Do ‘Muslim Lives Matter’ in greater scheme of
            Islam? Sita Ram Goel had an answer. In a country
            like India: ‘Islamism has evolved a strategy in
            which the Muslims of India are envisaged as a base
            and an arsenal’.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('muslimLivesAsset/image1.png')"></div>
        <p>
            2. Individual Muslim lives are seen by their
            ideologues and leaders as cannon fodder for the
            conquest of India. Some salient features of this
            strategy can be outlined as follows: (all quotes are
            from Sita Ram Goel’s book ‘Hindu Society Under
            Siege’)
            #ArrestPratikSinha</p>
        <p>
            3. “(a) The Muslims of India should be sealed off
            from every shade of rationalism, universalism,
            humanism and liberalism, and an army of mullahs
            and maulvis trained in the tenets of Islam should be
            let loose to brainwash and keep them along the
            right (Islamic) track;”</p>
        <p>
            4. “(b) Every Muslim who doesn’t accept Islamism
            or dares criticize it or stands for the mainstream of
            Indian nationalism, away from &amp; above
            religious differences, should be denounced as a
            renegade and a legitimate victim for murderous
            Muslim mobs” (remember the Maharashtra boy?)</p>
        <p>
            5. “(c) The Muslims should be encouraged to air as
            many grievances as can be invented, and try to pass
            off as a down-trodden minority, oppressed,
            exploited and treated as second class citizens by the
            brute Hindu majority;”
            #ImpeachJusticeKant</p>
        <p>
            6. “(d) These contrived grievances of Muslims
            should be used to convert the Muslim community
            into a compact vote-bank which can blackmail all
            non-Islamist political parties to accommodate
            Muslim candidates or include the maximum
            measure of concessions to the Muslim community;”</p>
        <p>
            7. “(e) The Muslims should be progressively
            prepared to stage street riots on the slightest
            pretext, be it a stray pig, or music before a mosque,
            or Urdu, or the minority character of the AMU, or a
            purely personal fracas between toughs belonging to
            two communities;”</p>
        <p>
            8. “(f) The frequent riots should be used to frighten
            the Muslims who should then be coaxed to create,
            consolidate and extend exclusive Muslim enclaves
            which can be stocked with arms and ammunition,
            imported or otherwise.”</p>
        <p>
            9. As we can see, Sita Ram Goel had foreseen the
            entire strategy which the Islamists still use today:
            which was used in the Nupur Sharma controversy
            leading up to the beheadings of innocent Hindus all
            over India. Meanwhile the Hindus are deluded with
            another strategy as follows:</p>
        <p>
            10. “(a) The concept of Secularism which is
            enshrined in the Constitution of India should be
            distorted, misinterpreted and misused to the
            maximum to block out the least little expression of
            Hindu culture in the state apparatus and public life
            of India;”</p>
        <p>
            11. “(b) The terms communal and communalism
            which have become terms of abuse in India’s
            political parlance, should be carefully cultivated
            and more and more mystified to malign all those
            organisations, institutions and parties which do not
            serve Islamism;”</p>
        <p>
            12. “(c) The accusation of being fascists and anti-
            secularists should be hurled at all who question the
            exclusive claims of Islam and its culture, who know
            and tell the truth about Islamic scripture and
            history, and who see through the Muslim game of
            grievances;”</p>
        <p>
            13. “(d) All praise and support should be extended
            to those Hindus who go out of their way to
            champion Islamic causes, national and
            international, and who see in Islam and its culture
            those higher values which Islamism claims for
            them;”</p>
        <p>
            14. “(e) All available platforms should be used to
            defeat and frustrate the emergence of a genuine and
            positive Indian nationalism by always harping on
            India’s multi-racial, multi-religious, multi-
            language, multi-national, and multi-cultural
            character.”</p>
        <p>
            15. This free flow of Islamic fundamentalism and
            full suppression of all and any dharma in India has
            resulted in a situation in which the Muslims
            dominate every aspect of public life. Sita Ram Ji
            says that adding Arab money the extremely
            dangerous situation is as follows:</p>
        <p>
            16. “(a) The rapid rise of a powerful press, mostly in
            Indian languages, and many publishing houses to
            propagate Islamism;” (Remember scroll, Wire,
            Quint, Caravan etc.)</p>
        <p>
            17. “(b) The generous funding of old and the
            founding of many new maktabs, madrasas and
            institutes for teaching Islam and training
            missionaries who are then employed at high
            salaries for purifying the faith of die Muslim flock
            and seeking new pastures for converts to Islam;”</p>
        <p>
            18. “(c) Buying of land and real estate all around in
            urban and rural areas by individual Muslims and
            Islamic institutions and organisations at whatever
            prices available;” (Waqf boards occupying India's
            land with mosques, imambaras and burial
            grounds.)</p>
        <p>
            19. “(d) Manufacturing and storing of arms in
            mosques, Muslim homes and localities and training
            of Muslim toughs;”</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('muslimLivesAsset/image2.png')"></div>
        <p>
            20. “(e) Holding of frequent conferences, national
            and international, and taking out demonstrations
            in support of every Islamic cause;”</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('muslimLivesAsset/image3.png')"></div>
        <p>
            21. “(f) Financing Muslim politics and inducing
            Muslim politicians to infiltrate and ingratiate
            themselves in every political party, and function
            from every public platform;”</p>
        <p>
            22. “(g) Bribing secularist Hindu intellectuals,
            scribes public workers and politicians, and buying
            them up for supporting Islamism, denigrating
            Hindu culture, and character-assassinating those
            who oppose Islamism;”</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('muslimLivesAsset/image4.png')"></div>
        <p>
            23. “(h) Using the lure of money for winning
            converts to Islam from the weaker sections of
            Hindu society, particularly the Harijans.”</p>
        <p>
            24. This is the current situation of Hindu society
            vis-à-vis Islam in India today. That is what SRG
            warned us about and the situation is many times
            worse today with the only thing is that through the
            efforts of SRG and other such scholars more
            Hindus are aware now.</p>
        <p>
            25. Let us keep that flame of knowledge alive and it
            will destroy every sort of ignorance.
            In the next thread, we will get to know what the
            strategy of Christianity is toward India.
