        <p>Thread: Here is a fascinating map of all the places of
            ancient India as mentioned in Mahābhārata.
            This map is put on display in Purana Qila, which is the
            ancient Indraprastha of Mahābhārata.
            Take a look at the map and check the name of your
            region during those days.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="
        height:500px;

        <p>Mahābhārata is simply the encyclopedia of ancient India.
            The geographical details are very comprehensive.
            Below in this thread, I shall elaborate upon every region
            To the NW in Afghanistan is country of Yavanas, the Bactrian
            Indo-Greeks (Modern Begram).
            To their East in Hindukush is the country of Aśvakas and
            Kāmbojas.
            The Kamviri Nuristanis of Afghanistan, Kamboj of Punjab and
            Kammas of Andhra Pradesh could be their partial descendants</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="
        height:300px;
        background-image:url('MahabharataAsset/image2.png');
        background-size:300px;
        "></div>
        <p>To their immediate east are the Cīnās, Lāḍakas (Ladakh) and
            Rāmaṭhas(Bhotas). These were Tibetan people . Chinese were
            known as Mahācīnās</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="
        height:300px;
        background-image:url('MahabharataAsset/image3.png');
        background-size:300px;"></div>
        <p>To the south of Kāmbojas is the country of Gāndhāra with its
            capital at Takshashila (Taxila). This is the Attock-Swat-Charsadda-
            Peshawar-Islamabad region. To the south of Gāndhāra is the
            kingdom of Kekaya, which is the modern Dera Ismail Khan region
            between Jhelum and Indus</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="
        height:300px;
        background-image:url('MahabharataAsset/image4.png');
        background-size:300px;
        "></div>
        <p>To their south is the kingdom of Sibi and its capital
            Sibipura(which is the modern Sehwan). To their east in the
            modern Majha region of Punjab is the ancient kingdom of Madrā.
            To their east is Vāhikas on the other side of the river Iravati(Ravi).</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="
        height:350px;
        background-image:url('MahabharataAsset/image5.png');
        background-size:350px;"></div>
        <p>Bahlikas is misplaced in this map and they should really belong to
            Balkh, Afghanistan. To the North of Vāhikas is the kingdom of
            Trigarta with its capital at Sakala(Sialkot). This is the Jammu-
            Sialkot region</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="
        height:350px;
        background-image:url('MahabharataAsset/image6.png');
        background-size: 350px;
        "></div>
        <p>To their north is the kingdom of Kashmir (Kaśmīra) with its
            capital at Rājapura (Rajouri). Remember that Shrinagara
            (Srinagar) was established by Ashoka who post dates
            Mahābhārata. As such, it does not appear in this map</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="
        height:350px;
        background-image:url('MahabharataAsset/image7.png');
        background-size:350px;
        "></div>
        <p>To the North of Kashmir is the kingdom of Daradas (dards of
            Gilgit-Chitral-Yasin). To the east of Trigarta is the kingdom of
            "Audumbaras" which is the ancient kingdom of Himachal. To
            their east is the kingdom of "Khasas" who are the Nepali people
            speaking "Khaskura"</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="
        height:350px;
        background-image:url('MahabharataAsset/image8.png');
        background-size:350px"></div>
        <p>Interestingly, Malavas and Yaudheyas still inherit the Indus-Satluj
            region in the Mahābhārata. In the post Mahābhārata age, Malavas
            win over lands from east Punjab to Madhya Pradesh. Malwa of
            East Punjab (Ludhiana) and Malwa of Madhya Pradesh is still
            named after this tribe</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="
        height:350px;
        background-image:url('MahabharataAsset/image9.png');
        background-size:350px;"></div>
        <p>Yaudheyas also moved east and conquered Haryana region. They
            established their capital at Rohitaka (Rohtak). To the south of
            Punjab are 'Sauviras', who are the modern 'Saraiki' speakers of
            Sindh-Multan</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="
        height:350px;
        background-image:url('MahabharataAsset/image10.png');
        background-size:350px;"></div>
        <p>To their east is the kingdom of Kuru, the modern Haryana region
            around Delhi. It had two capitals- Indraprastha (Delhi) and
            Hastinapura (Meerut). To their South-East is the kingdom of
            Panchalas. It also had two capitals. "Ahicchatra" in the north and
            "Kampilya" in the south</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('MahabharataAsset/image11.png')"></div>
        <p>According to Mahābhārata, Ahicchatra was ruled by Drona's son
            Ashvatthama. As Guru Dakshina, Arjuna brought before Drona
            the King Drupada as a captive. Drupada then gave the state of
            Ahicchatra to Droṇa and got his release. (Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
            Ślokas 73 to 76, Chapter 137)
            To the west of Panchalas is the kingdom of "Yadus" with its capital
            at Mathura. To their south is the kingdom of "Kuntala" (Gwalior)
            and "Nishada" (Bundelkhand). The west of Mathura was
            conquered by other Yadu tribes like 'Andhakas" and 'Surasenas'</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('MahabharataAsset/image12.png')"></div>
        <p>The Matysa kingdom belonged to Jaipur region with its capital at
            Viratanagara (modern Bairat). Vatsa was the ancient kingdom of
            prayaga region with its capital at 'Kaushambi'. "Magadha" is the
            modern patna region with its capital at Girivraja (Rajgir)</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('MahabharataAsset/image13.png')"></div>
        <p>North Bihar (Mithila) region was inhabited by 'Videhas' with their
            capital at 'Mithila'. Vrijis had their capital at Sravasti (Balrampur).
            To their west was the kingdom of Kosalas with its capital at
            Ayodhya</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="
        height:350px;
        background-image:url('MahabharataAsset/image14.png');
        background-size:350px;"></div>
        <p>To the west of Andhra was the kingdom of 'Kuntala' which is the
            modern day "Uttara Kannada" and South Maharastra region. To
            the North-West of Kuntala was Goa which was then known as
            Aparanta. To the South of Kuntala is the kingdom of Karnata
            which is the Bangalore region</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('MahabharataAsset/image15.png')"></div>
        <p>In the Karna Parva(12.15) of Mahabharata, all three kingdoms:
            Pandyas, Keralas and Cholas are clubbed as "Dravidas". Described
            as tall and broad chested warriors with courage like that of
            ruttish elephant. Dravida= entire region comprising today's
            Tamilnadu and Kerala</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('MahabharataAsset/image16.png')"></div>
        <p>In the Mahabharata war, the Pandya king fought on the side of
            Pandavas. He slaughtered the armies of Duryodhana. He
            slaughtered the Bahlikas, Khasas, Kuntalas. His bravery was
            praised in Mahabharata. In the end, he was kiIIed by the Drona's
            valiant son Aśvatthāmā</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('MahabharataAsset/image17.png')"></div>
        <p>The city of Gokarna in the South Konkana region was already
            famous in Mahabharata (3.275 vulgate) as "the favorite resort of
            Lord Shiva". Agastya's hermitage existed to the south of it. And it
            was here that Vatapi was "digested" by Agastya according to
            Puranic lore</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('MahabharataAsset/image18.png')"></div>
        <p>In the Central India roughly corresponding to Malwa region and
            western Madhya pradesh was the country of "Avanti". Ujjayani
            (Ujjain) was the capital of Northern Avanti and Mahishmati on
            the banks of 'Narmada' was the capital of Southern Avanti</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="
        height:350px;
        background-image:url('MahabharataAsset/image19.png');
        background-size:350px;"></div>
        <p>According to Mahabharata, Mahishmati had a formidable fortress
            protected by Lord Agni himself who had never been conquered in
            the past. Sahadeva appeased the God by offering a Yajna before
            he went on to conquer the city.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('MahabharataAsset/image20.png')"></div>
        <p>To the north of Kalinga was the country of "Odras" which is
            today's "Western Odisha". This region was famous for the
            Mahendragiri mountain which according to Mahabharata and
            Ramayana was a resting place of Lord Parashurama. Its capital
            was Manipura near today's Kendrapara</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('MahabharataAsset/image21.png')"></div>
        <p>It must be mentioned that the Manipura of Mahabharata is near
            the Mahendragiri mountain (on the Andhra-Odisha border in
            Gajapati district/Srikakulam district). Today's "Manipur" in the
            North East got its name AFTER 17th century. (It was earlier
            known as Kangleipak).</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('MahabharataAsset/image22.png')"></div>
        <p>Today's Manipur in NE India was actually renamed by Vaishnava
            migrants from this place. To the north of Brahman river was the
            country of "Utkalas". To its North in the Padma basin was the
            country of "Vanga", which is today's Padma Delta of southern
            Bangladesh</p>
