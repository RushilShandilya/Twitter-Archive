        <h1>Fibonacci and it's Indian Heritage</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>This is nothing but THEFT and appropriation of Indian
            Heritage. <br><br>
            While this might look very trivial at the outset, this is a
            very major cultural appropriation. <br><br>
            This threads explains the Golden ratio, its history and
            its modern appropriation <br><br>
            [Thread]
            What is Golden ratio? <br><br>
            In mathematics, two quantities are in the golden ratio if
            their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the
            larger of the two quantities. <br><br>
            If two numbers be designated by a and b (a&gt;b&gt;0),
            then they are aid to be in Golden ratio if a/b=(a+b)/a
            Thus, Golden Ratio is solution to quadratic x2-x-
            1=0(assuming a to be x and b to be 1 in the same ratio).
            This approximates to 1.618033. <br>
            Since in a Fibonacci series every number(except first
            &amp; second) is sum of the previous two, golden ratio
            approximates ratio of larger/smaller <br><br>
            How is Golden ratio important? <br><br>
            Golden nature is everywhere in the nature. Infact,
            Golden ratio is called Divine proportion. <br><br>
            According to latest research, universe is governed by
            Golden ratio. <br><br>
            Universe has a golden ratio that keeps everything in
            order
            <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2014/12/do_we_live_in_a/">Relevant Article</a>
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('FibonacciAsset/image.png')"></div>
        <p>Infact, the Golden ratio of Fibonacci series can be seen
            everywhere around us in the universe. <br><br>
            The petals of a flower and seed heads follow a Fibonacci
            series where each consecutive cycle is in golden ratio
            with the previous one</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('FibonacciAsset/image2.png')"></div>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('FibonacciAsset/image3.png')"></div>
        <p>The Fibonacci series and its Golden ratio can be seen in
            the tree branches and shells <br></br>
            It can be seen in hurricanes and reproductive organs</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('FibonacciAsset/image4.png')"></div>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('FibonacciAsset/image5.png')"></div>

        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('FibonacciAsset/image7.png')"></div>

        <p>It can be seen in human body including face and
            fingers. <br><br>
            It could be seen everywhere in the universe and in fact
            all the galaxies follow Fibonnacci sequence and have a
            golden ratio which keeps the universe in order</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('FibonacciAsset/image8.png')"></div>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('FibonacciAsset/image9.png')"></div>

        <p>Thus, Fibonacci series &amp; its Golden Ratio is one of
            the most important discoveries in the history of
            mankind. <br><br>
            Who discovered it first? <br><br>
            Fibonacci series was not discovered by ancient Greeks
            and Westerners. It does not appear in European before
            Leonardo Fibonacci (13th century) <br><br>
            Now, many Propogandists from all over the world are
            suggesting that Fibonacci took his Golden Series from
            Africa just because he lived in a trading port on the
            North African coast in his childhood. <br><br>
            Is this true? Let us examine the facts.

            <a href="https://scroll.in/article/990018/todays-global-design-aesthetic-may-have-its-roots-in-africa">Relevant
                Article</a>
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('FibonacciAsset/image10.png')"></div>

        <p>What the propagandists say: Fibonacci lived in Africa.<br><br>
            What they don't say: Fibonacci lived in a colony of
            INDIAN merchants in North Africa. There were hardly
            any African residents except probably a handful of
            slaves.<br><br>
            Let us see what Fibonacci himself says in his own book<br><br>
            In the introduction to his book, Fibonacci (c. 13th
            century CE) makes the following revelations 1) "I am
            the son of an official working in Bugia, Algeria". 2)
            There was a colony of Indian Merchants in that city. 3)
            "It was there that I was introduced to Indian
            Mathematics".<br><br>
            Fibonacci further says- " I loved Indian Mathematics to
            such an extent above all others that I completely
            devoted myself to it". <br><br>
            "I was also introduced to Greek, Arabic &amp;
            Egyptian Math" .<br><br>
            "But I found ALL of them,EVEN Pythagoras, to be
            erroneous compared to Indian Mathematics"</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('FibonacciAsset/image11.png')"></div>
        <p>Fibonacci further says: "For this reason, basing my
            book COMPLETELY on Indian methods and applying
            myself with greatest attention to it, but not without
            adding something of my own thought, I forced myself to
            compose this book. <br><br>
            I demonstrated everything with proof"</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('FibonacciAsset/image11.png')"></div>
        <p>Finally, Fibonacci says:
            " In my book, I have published the doctrine of
            Mathematics completely according to the Method of
            Indians. <br><br>
            I have COMPLETELY adopted the (Mathematical)
            Method of Indians because it is the MOST effective"</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('FibonacciAsset/image12.png')"></div>
        <p>Thus, in his book, Fibonacci does NOT refer to
            #Fibonacci Series as "Fibonacci Series".<br><br>
            Rather, he simply calls it "Indian Series".<br><br>
            Unlike many other Europeans, Fibonacci was NOT a
            plagiarist. He clearly mentioned his source and
            acknowledged his credit to ancient Indians.<br><br>
            Fibonacci's introduction makes it clear that he
            considered himself "Indian Mathematician" insomuch
            as he adhered to Indian Mathematical Methodology
            and contributed to it.<br><br>
            The real name of the so called "Fibonacci Series" is
            "Indian Series".<br><br>
            This comes from the horse's mouth !<br><br>
            So far as the so called "Fibonacci Series" is concerned,
            Fibonacci was only TRANSLATING the Sutras of
            Pingala (c.3rd century CE) and his commentator
            Virahanka who derived "Fibonacci Series" several
            hundreds of years before Fibonacci was even born</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image:url('FibonacciAsset/image13.png')"></div>
        <p>I was very shocked reading Fibonacci's introduction.
            Why are these facts kept concealed? A more important
            question. Why should it be called 'Fibonacci series'
            when Fibonacci himself does not claim to have
            discovered it and simply acknowledges Indian
            Mathematics as his source?<br><br>
            The precepts of Pythagoras and Euclid were forgotten
            in early middle ages and revived only later. Yet, the
            credit always goes to Pythagoras and Euclid. Never to
            the later day Mathematicians who revived their works.
            Why is Pingala never extended the same courtesy? I
            wonder why!<br><br>
            Fibonacci was NOT a European Mathematician, except
            by flesh and blood. He explicitly rejected the European
            methodology of Mathematics.<br><br>
            He denounced even the path of Pythagoras as
            "erroneous".<br><br>
            He followed footsteps of exemplary Vaidika
            Mathematicians like Pingala and Virahanka
            Fibonacci does not describe his book as "European
            Mathematics".<br><br>
            He explicitly describes his book as " treatise on Indian
            Mathematical methods".<br><br>
            As such, it is hard to even consider him a "European
            Mathematician".<br><br>
            He followed the footsteps of Vaidika Sanskritic
            Mathematicians</p>
