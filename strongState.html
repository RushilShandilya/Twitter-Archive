            A monumental misunderstanding rises from the
            quarters of Foreign Policy &amp; International
            Relations. That all you need to fight Religion of
            Peace (Iz!@m) is to have a strong State with perfect
            ‘law &amp; order’. Nothing is further from truth.</p>

        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('/StrongStateAsset/image1.png')"></div>

        <p> 2. RoP doesn’t fight just at the borders. RoP doesn’t
            fight just with the soldiers. RoP doesn’t fight with a
            legal code. RoP doesn’t fight with a moral code. RoP
            doesn’t just fight with men.
            #Howrah</p>
        <p>
            3. RoP fights in your streets, in your homes, in your
            malls and vegetable stalls. RoP fights with civilians,
            artists, journalists, academicians and more. RoP
            doesn’t fight with a moral or legal code. RoP fights
            with men, women, children and old people.</p>
        <p>
            4. No State is capable of fighting with conventional
            methods because RoP fights an unconventional
            war, like it does in Kashmir, where every follower of
            that faith is a soldier in their war. How will an
            army, or an atom bomb matter when fight is going
            on in streets?</p>
        <p>
            5. Which State can come to help you when it is your
            doodhwala who can cut your wife’s throat; when it
            is your maid who can harm your kid; when it is
            your guard who can chop off your head? The state
            might come later and punish them 25 years later.
            But it won’t save your life.</p>
        <p>
            6. I repeat, this is NOT a conventional war. RoP is a
            permanent war machine. Their founder weaponized
            every aspect of life and turned life itself into war.
            Jih@d is a total war which means that you make
            war with everything you do in life: eating, shitting,
            loving, voting etc.</p>
        <p>
            7. No atom bomb can enter your streets and kill
            people selectively. No army or police can save your
            life when your enemy is living besides you all the
            time. Yes, they can punish but that’s immaterial
            once lives are lost. This is NOT a conventional war.
            It is a TOTAL war.</p>
        <p>
            8. No FP or IR analysis is applicable on RoP,
            because RoP is a civilizational force with a long arc
            of 1400 years. Disciplines which were born to prop
            government policy in the past 150 years are
            designed not to understand civilizational forces like
            RoP and RoL. </p>
        <p>
            9. FP/ IR lens is myopic, for it can’t see beyond a
            few years of actions. And so it will blame the
            current unrest, just like Iz!@mic apologists, on the
            actions of Hindu society, State or orgs. Just like the
            leftists do when they blame America or Israel for
            global RoP unrest.</p>
        <p>
            10. Just like a person standing on a ground cannot
            see the curvature of Earth because he is just 6 feet
            tall, similarly, anyone committed to FP/ IR lens
            can’t see long arcs of history, culture, religion and
            civilization which are 2000 or 1400 years long.</p>
        <p>
            11. That myopia is dangerous, for it doesn’t just
            ignore the knowledge that it can’t understand, but
            completely negates it, claiming what doesn’t fall in
            FP/ IR purview doesn’t exist. To listen to that lens
            is to fall asleep in battlefield when the enemy is
            gathering.</p>
        <p>
            12. For them the very meanings of words are
            different. ‘Success’ is defined as apprehending a
            handful of terrorists in jail, not understanding that
            the RoP terrorists are like Raktabeeja and the more
            you kill the more they grow. It is their ideology
            which needs to be fought.</p>
        <p>
            13. ‘Success’ for these FP/ IR people is defined by
            narrowing down the time period under discussion
            to a few decades and claiming some statistics that
            terrorist attacks came down by 3.27%, and claiming
            it as victory, not knowing that in 1400 years long
            war, 2 decades are nothing. </p>
        <p>
            14. In the long run, RoP has always won regardless
            of the political success or defeat of its kings, States,
            governments etc. They don’t care about individuals.
            They care about religion. About ideology. And in
            that they have always grown in the past 1400 years.</p>
        <p>
            15. RoP has to be fought ideologically &amp; not
            ‘strategically’. RoP has to be fought in your brains
            and not just in international forums. RoP has to be
            fought in your streets and not just at your borders.
            RoP has to be found amongst your friends, and not
            just amongst your enemies. </p>
        <p>
            16. The first step to do is to be completely aware of
            the nature of RoP. And in this war, there is no gray
            shade. Anyone who is not a friend, is an enemy,
            don’t forget. I will keep making threads
            illuminating some key aspects of this total war in
            the coming days. </p>
        <p>
            17. This does not mean that State should not be
            strong. That Army should not be big. That our
            police should not be vigilant. All that should be
            there. But that alone will never win the war. We
            need to fight TOTAL war with TOTAL response.</p>
        <p>
            18. When a fundamentally dangerous idea is
            misunderstood, to inform about that is not
            paranoia. Instead to not try to understand and
            ignore it is amnesia. RoP is a 1400 years old big
            idea which has created a TOTAL war machine. It is
            imperative to understand this fact</p>
