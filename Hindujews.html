        <p>
            India and Israel. Hindus and Jews. <br><br>
            This thread is about the history of the mutual
            interaction and relation between two of the oldest
            extent civilizations of the world. <br><br>
            We will also look at how appeasement politics
            alienated our ally and affected our own
            international position <br><br>
            The earliest trade contact between Hebrews and
            Hindus could have dated back to the era of David
            and Solomon.
            "The king had trading ships at sea along with ships
            of Hiram. Every three years it returned, carrying
            gold, silver and ivory, and apes and baboons" <br><br>
            Bible( Kings 10.22)
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduJewsAsset/image.png')"></div>
        <p>
            According to the Old Testament, Ophir was the
            name of the place famous for its wealth. Solomon
            traded gold, silver, sandalwood, pearls, ivory, apes,
            and peacocks
        </p>
        <p>
            Modern scholars have identified Ophir with Abhira
            kingdom of western India
        </p>

        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduJewsAsset/image1.png')"></div>
        <p>But the first large scale migration of Jewish
            refugees to India was after Roman destruction of
            Jerusalem.<br><br>
            Indian Jewish tradition says first wave of Jewish
            refugees landed on Kerala coast at Kodungallur in
            70 CE.<br><br>
            Painting from Paradesi Synagogue(Mattanchery)
            depicts the scene
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduJewsAsset/image2.png')"></div>
        <p> The Hindu Maharaja of Kodungallur cordially
            received the Jewish refugees.<br><br>
            He granted them land, freedom of life &amp;
            freedom to practice religion.<br><br>
            Painting from Paradesi Synagogue depicts the king
            welcoming Jewish refugees.<br><br>

            The king is with full entourage bearing colored
            parasols
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduJewsAsset/image3.png')"></div>
        <p> This cordial sanctuary offered by the Hindu
            Maharajas encouraged other Jews to migrate to
            Kerala for centuries when they faced persecution in
            the west.<br><br>
            Jewish tradition says their leader Joseph Rabban
            received many privileges from Hindu Maharaja
            including tax free land &amp; guild.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduJewsAsset/image4.png')"></div>
        <p>
            There is also an inscription which substantiates this
            tradition.<br><br>
            Cochin plates of Bhaskara Ravi Varman record a
            grant to Jewish merchant Joseph Rabban.<br><br>
            He was exempted from tax payment &amp;
            granted hereditary succession<br><br>
            Inscription's dated by historians from 8th to 11th
            century</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduJewsAsset/image5.png')"></div>
        <p> What was special about the inscription?<br><br>
            It granted Jews rights that were the preserve of the
            royal family alone, including firing three salutes
            at daybreak and on the day of a marriage.<br><br>
            It virtually gave Rabban status of a king, and Kerala
            Jewish songs call him "King of Jews"
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduJewsAsset/image6.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Thus, the Jews were not only accepted by Hindus
            with open arms, they were also granted special
            privileges and they happily thrived<br><br>
            Soon, they began dominating trade on western
            coast.<br><br>
            This is the only instance in Jewish history where
            the Jews were not religiously persecuted
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduJewsAsset/image7.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Hindu India became such a welcoming home for
            Jews that thousands of Sephardic Jews of Spain
            fled to Kerala in 15th/16th century during
            inquisition<br><br>
            Today their descendants are known as "Paradesi
            Jews" (whites).<br><br>
            They have a song which reads- "Hindus are our true
            brothers"
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduJewsAsset/image8.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, Antisemitism also followed Jews to
            India.<br><br>
            In 1524, the Jewish settlement of Kodungallur was
            destroyed by a MÎ¼slim army over a pepper feud.
            The Jewish houses and Synagogues were burnt.<br><br>
            The last Jewish prince swam to Kochi. Kochi then
            became the town of Jews.</p>

        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduJewsAsset/image9.png')"></div>
        <p>
            The Hindu Raja of Kochi not only welcomed the
            Jewish refugees, but he also allowed them to build a
            Synagogue next to the Royal Palace and Royal
            temple.<br><br>
            The painting depicts construction of Synagogue.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduJewsAsset/image10.png')"></div>
        <p>
            The Indian Jews were also persecuted by
            Portuguese during Vatican Inquisition.<br><br>
            This led to migration of Jews to Kochi.<br><br>
            The Maharaja allowed them to construct many
            Synagogues.<br><br>
            The Paradesi Synagogue of Kochi was constructed
            in 1568 under the auspices of the Maharaja.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduJewsAsset/image11.png')"></div>
        <p>Even today, the Paradesi Synagogue and the Royal
            fort temple of Kochi stand next to each other </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduJewsAsset/image12.png')"></div>
        <p> Further, it was a tradition among the Maharajas of
            Kochi to gift golden crowns to the Paradesi
            Synagogue.<br><br>
            These are still preserved and put in display at the
            Synagogue</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduJewsAsset/image13.png')"></div>
        <p>
            After the Balfour Declaration of 1917 confirmed
            British intention to create a Jewish homeland,
            many Kerala Jews expressed desire to go to British
            Palestine.<br><br>
            Maharaja Rama Varma XVII of Kochi helped 8000
            Jews migrate to the Jewish Holy land. He
            personally bore their expenses</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduJewsAsset/image14.png')"></div>
        <p>
            This "Tolerance" shown by Maharaja was striking.
            According to scholar Nathan Hatz, he would not
            fight battles on Sabbath considering sentiments of
            his Jewish subjects.<br><br>
            He would also not offer prayer to family goddess on
            Sabbath because of Jewish reservations on
            "idolatry!"<br><br>
            The Hindus and Jews have a history of long cultural
            and intellectual exchange.<br><br>
            The Jewish astronomer Sanad Ibn Al Yahudi ( 9th
            century CE) translated Surya Siddhanta into Arabic
            and wrote a treatise on it.
