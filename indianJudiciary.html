            #NupurSharma quoted from Islamic scriptures. Indian courts blamed her instead of
            scriptures or those who issued her death threats. This was essentially victim-shaming
            &amp; it has a history. Read on.

            2. Nupur was quoting verbatim from the Islamic scriptures; that too in response of
            constantly horrible insults of Hindu gods by Mullahs. Islamic world erupted after dog-
            whistling by Zuber and Rana. She started receiving death threats/ rape threats.

            3. Muslims started rioting all over India, threatening Hindu society and Indian state.
            Then several Islamic terrorists beheaded various innocent Hindus all across India,
            including Udaipur where they made boastful videos singing ‘Sar Tan se Juda…’

        <p>
            4. Nupur got slapped with various FIRs under Article 295A of the IPC. Ironically,
            neither the writers nor the followers of the scriptures which she quoted are under legal
            scrutiny, but Nupur Sharma who just quoted is. But this victim shaming has
            precedence in Indian history.

            5. On July 20, 1984 one “Himangshu Kishore Chakraborty wrote to the Secretary,
            Department of Home, Govt. West Bengal, pointing out that the Quran contains matter
            which makes its publication an offence under Sections 153A and 295A of the I.P.C.”
        </p>
        <p>
            6. “In 3 Annexures to his letter, he cited sayings of the Quran - 37 sayings which preach
            cruelty, incite violence and disturb public peace; 17 sayings which promote, on ground
            of religion, feelings of enmity, hatred and ill-will between different religious
            communities in India.”
        </p>
        <p>
            7. “…and 31 sayings which insult other religions as also the religious beliefs of other
            communities.” Of course Chakraborty’s letter (and a remainder) remained unanswered.
            (All quotes are of Sita Ram Goel in ‘Calcutta Quran Petition’)

        <p>
            8. He then met Chandmal Chopra. Chopra also sent a letter to the Secretary, WB,
            demanding justice. When he did not receive any answer, he filed on: “March 29, 1985
            his famous Writ Petition in the Calcutta High Court under Article 226 of the Indian
            Constitution.”
        </p>
        <p>
            9. Justice Padma Khastgir addresses the petition and assigns it to another bench after a
            secular sermon saying that “no earthly power can sit upon judgment on it and no court
            of law has jurisdiction to adjudicate it.” Even then all Hell broke loose.
        </p>
        <p>
            10. Islamic mobs started rioting (just like today), driving Hindu leaders to bend over
            backwards to appease fundamentalist Islam. Jyoti Basu, Balram Jakhar &amp;
            everyone in general started throwing abuse against the petitioner and the judge for not
            dismissing the petition outright.
        </p>
        <p>
            11. Chopra was instructed to file the affidavit by May 17. But the matter was pre-empted
            on May 13. The Court was prepared and dismissed the Petition without further ado
            without giving Chopra any time to argue. More sermons on secularism followed.
        </p>
        <p>
            12. Just Khastgir was lacerated for not being secular enough. Judges were terrified that
            just by transferring and not dismissing outright, she indicated that there WAS a case in
            the Quranic verses inciting violence. Interestingly though, the verses were not
            discussed at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            13. Another case came in metropolitan magistrate court in Delhi. Two persons had been
            charged under Section 153A for publishing in a poster 24 Ayats of the Quran and
            stating that riots in India cannot be stopped so long as those Ayats remained in the
            Quran.
        </p>
        <p>
            14. The metropolitan magistrate, Shri Z. S. Lohat, however, drew a contrary conclusion.
            His judgment is legendary and will be known in the annals of Indian history as an
            exercise of courage and commitment to deep truth. He acquitted the two accused.
        </p>
        <p>
            15. He pronounced on 31 July 1986: “With due regard, to the Holy Book of Quran
            Majeed, a close perusal of the Ayets shows that the same are harmful and teach hatred
            and are likely to create differences between Mohammedans on one hand and the
            remaining communities on the other.”
        </p>
        <p>
            16. With the exception of Judge Lohat, how the Indian Judiciary behaved in Calcutta
            High Court is exactly like the way it behaved in Delhi yesterday. They blamed the
            victim instead of the culprit. The quoted verses unequivocally display hatred for non-
            Muslims.
        </p>
        <p>
            17. Hatred of other religions, their followers and particularly the ‘idol worshippers’ is
            deep within Islam, the Quran and the Hadith. Islam rose as a revolt against idol
            worshipping tribes of Arabia and consequently has iconoclasm and hatred of
            polytheism embedded in it.
        </p>
        <p>
            18. This is something that no Muslim denies and they proudly proclaim their
            superiority of not worshiping ‘but’ – ‘idols’. But in a country like India this ideology is
            of course a source of violence with Hindus. This is an issue which needs to be
            addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
            19. Chandmal Chopra and Himanshu Chakraborty were verbatim quoting from the
            Quran and they got reprimanded by the court for it. Just like Nupur Sharma. They are
            both pointing out violent and uncomfortable verses &amp; facts written in Islamic
            scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
            20. Any logical or human mind would instead reprimand the source of the book or the
            author instead of a person who is just pointing it out. And yet in both cases we see that
            Indian judiciary not only refused to look into Islamic scriptures, but blamed &amp;
            shamed the victims.
        </p>
        <p>
            21. The Nupur Sharma case is not without precedence. The Calcutta Quran Petition is
            precedence. Why it is so shocking for the Muslim society is that these cases are turning
            tables against the violent hegemony that Islamists are used to.
        </p>
        <p>
            22. They are used to burn pagan books &amp; destroy their temples. This is the first
            time pagans are questioning their Book. This is something they cannot digest because
            Muslims have an inherent superiority complex. However for Hindus to exist, this status
            quo needs to be broken.
        </p>
