            A pernicious attempt to connect Hinduism with Nazism.
            <br><br>
            Audrey (@audreyTruschke) claims Indic philosophy inspired Nazism &amp; Nazism inspired Hindu revivalism.
            <br><br>
            She comes from a long line of protestant Indologists making such connections.
            But is it really so?
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduNazisAsset/image.png')"></div>
        <p>
            @AudreyTruschke Audrey insists Nazi "Hakenkreuz" is
            nothing but "German translation" of Swastika.
            <br><br>
            She even goes on to say the Nazi translation did not erase
            "the basic meaning and history" of swastika.
            <br><br>
            Is this really so?
            <br><br>
            This thread EXPOSES closely guarded academic secrets
            about this topic
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduNazisAsset/image2.png')"></div>
        <p>@AudreyTruschke As I have mentioned elsewhere, Hitler
            never used the word Swastika himself. He used the word
            Hakenkreuz.
            <br><br>
            This claim is FALSE.
            <br><br>
            Germans did not use "Hakenkreuz" for Swastika. They used
            it for Christian hooked cross.
            <br><br>
            Hakenkreuz is literal German translation of "hooked cross"
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduNazisAsset/image3.png')"></div>
        <p>@AudreyTruschke But what is Hakenkreuz/ Hooked cross?
            What did Nazis understand by it?
            <br><br>
            What were they so enamored by this symbol? Did they see
            the symbol as mere translation of Indic symbol Swastika?
            <br><br>
            Did they see the Hakenkreuz as an ancient Indian symbol?
            Did they borrow this Indian symbol?
            <br><br>
            Only the contemporary Nazi literature can tell us what the
            Nazis actually thought about Swastika.
            <br><br>
            I begin by considering the views of Erich Koch. Koch was a
            top officer of Nazi Germany. He organised Nazi
            concentration camps. He was sentenced to life
            imprisonment after the war.
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduNazisAsset/image4.png')"></div>
        <p>However, Erich Koch was not just a Nazi who gαssed people
            to dεath in concentration camps.
            <br><br>
            He was a president of German protestant Church Synod. He
            was a scholar of Bible and would recite the entire New
            Testament orally.
            <br><br>
            As such, his views about Hakenkreuz are very revealing
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduNazisAsset/image5.png')"></div>
        <p>
            "Truly, Christ has returned. The second coming of Christ has
            happened.
            <br><br>
            Christ has now come in the form of Hitler. He has come to
            exterminate the Marxists and the irreligious. He now comes
            not with a cross but with the hooked cross (Haken Kreuz)"
            - Erich Koch.
            <br><br>
            Koch was a brutal, ruthless Nazi of the first order. He
            personified Nazi barbarity by playing a leading role in the
            murdεr of thousands of Jews and their deportation to
            camps.
            <br><br>
            Yet, even in his post war testimony, he insisted that he was
            doing nothing but the work of Christ!
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduNazisAsset/image6.png')"></div>
        <p>
            Koch was not alone.
            <br><br>
            Even Joseph Goebbels, one of Hitler's closest acolytes, held
            similar eschatological Christian views about "hooked cross".
            <br><br>
            He saw Nazism as an apocalyptic movement that personifies
            Christ's mission of destroying Anti-Christian Jewish and
            Marxist forces.
            <br><br>
            At the end of his autobiographical diary named Michael,
            Joseph Goebbels declares-<br><br>
            "The war we are now waging today is a struggle between
            Jesus Christ and Marx"
        </p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduNazisAsset/image7.png')"></div>
        <p>Hans Schemm was an educator and a top minister of Nazi
            Germany.<br><br>
            He famously declared -"Our religion is Christ, our politics is
            motherland".<br><br>
            Explaining the meaning of Nazi Hakenkreuz, he also alluded
            to Hitler as a personification of Christ.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduNazisAsset/image8.png')"></div>
        <p>"In its first appearance, the cross used to be straight because
            Christ had come with love.<br><br>
            Now, the day of judgement has arrived. The cross is hooked
            (referring to Hakenkreuz) because Christ has come with
            wrath. Redeem yourself"- Hans Schemm<br><br>
            Christian eschatology was at the core of Nazi ideology since
            inception.<br><br>
            When Nazi party was founded, Hitler announced 25-point
            Program.<br><br>
            Point 24 says Nazi Party advocates "positive Christianity".<br><br>
            It "combats Jewish spirit within &amp; around us"</p>
        <a href="https://alphahistory.com/nazigermany/nazi-party-25-points-1920/">Relevant Article</a>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduNazisAsset/image9.png')"></div>
        <p>It is clear that Hakenkreuz of Nazis had absolutely nothing
            to Swastika of Hindus.<br><br>
            Nazi Hakenkreuz had a Christian eschatological concept of
            second coming of the Christ with the hooked cross.<br><br>
            Why then has the Nazi hooked cross been dissociated from
            its Christian background?<br><br>
            Why has Nazi Hooked Cross been dissociated with its
            Christian roots &amp; identified with Hindu swastika?<br><br>
            There is absolutely NO EVIDENCE that Nazis borrowed this
            symbol from India.<br><br>
            In fact, hooked cross has always been one of Church motifs.<br><br>
            There is Hooked Cross motif in Vatican</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduNazisAsset/image10.png')"></div>
        <p>After Nazis lost the war &amp; were disgraced when their
            crimes were out for the world to see, any association with
            Nazis was deemed unpopular.<br><br>
            Christian apologists spilled a lot of ink to
        <ol>
            <li>Dissociate Nazism from Christianity.</li>
            <li>Dissociate Hooked Cross with Christian cross</li>
        </ol>
        Hitler's autobiography Mein Kampf was translated into
        English by Christian pastor James Murphy.<br><br>
        He translated "Hooked Cross" as "Swastika" which was a
        visually similar but completely unrelated symbol.<br><br>
        "Swastika" coming from "Swasti" (well being) was infact
        truly opposite to it<br><br>
        With this intentionally flawed translation, he wanted to kiII
        two birds in one shot.<br><br>
        <ol>
            <li>Dissociate Nazis with Christianity.</li>
            <li>Associate Nazis with Hinduism.</li>
        </ol>
        This was later followed by all other translators.<br><br>
        No, Nazis DID not STEAL Hindu symbol. Nazis hated
        Hindus because Hindus aren't "Aryan race" according to the
        Nazi conception.<br><br>
        Hitler infact advised Churchill to kiII all Indians.<br><br>
        It was actually Christian missionaries who stole swastika
        and associated it with Nazi hooked cross<br><br>
        So deeply entrenched and widely prevalent is this
        propaganda that even NCERT textbook says
        "Hitler understood the significance of rituals ....and used
        ancient Swastika to install unity"</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduNazisAsset/image11.png')"></div>

        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('')"></div>
        <p>The evidence exists for all to see<br><br>
            In their rallies, the Nazis frequently used Hooked Cross in
            association with cross.<br><br>
            Here is a Nazi rally at berlin. Notice the hooked cross in
            association with the biblical cross on the flag</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduNazisAsset/image12.png')"></div>
        <p>
            During Nazi era, both the cross and hooked cross were very
            frequently intertwined and exchanged for one another.<br><br>
            Here is the official flag of German Christian movement.
            Notice the hooked cross signifying the second coming of
            Christ depicted in place of Jesus on the cross
        </p>

        <p>Berlin. Luther day 1933. Speech by bishop Hossenfelder<br><br>
            The symbol of hooked cross inscribed on Biblical cross can
            be clearly seen</p>

        <p>Hooked cross on Antoniter Church altar. 1935.<br><br>
            Devotees visiting the church used to touch the hooked cross
            and utter "Das ist Jesus Christus" ( "That is Jesus Christ").<br><br>
            How can this be Hindu symbol?</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduNazisAsset/image15.png')"></div>
        <p>The meaning and interpretation of hooked cross and its
            association with Christianity will be explored further.<br><br>
            Taking a brief detour to Audrey's thread.<br><br>
            Here, she associates Nazism with Hindu revivalism and
            Savarkar again.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduNazisAsset/image16.png')"></div>
        <p>She claims that Savarkar's swastika is actually Nazi. <br><br>
            She claims that Hindu Nationalists intentionally displayed
            the angle of Swastika midway between Nazi and Indian
            uses?<br><br>
            But is that really so? This tweet completely exposes Audrey's
            ignorance.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduNazisAsset/image17.png')"></div>
        <p>Audrey claims that any Swastika depicted with a slanting
            angle is not Hindu Swastika but Nazi symbol.<br><br>
            This betrays Audrey's utter ignorance about the subject.<br><br>
            Hindu Swastikas are often depicted with a slanting angle. It
            is very common to see slanting swastikas on Hindu temples.</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduNazisAsset/image18.png')"></div>
        <p>It is funny that Audrey associates Savarkar's book Hindutva
            with Nazism<br><br>
            She would not have made such clueless &amp; ignorant
            remarks had she read that book.<br><br>
            Far from showing any anti-semitic Nazism, Savarkar
            actually expresses in that book his desire for a Jewish
            homeland in Israel</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduNazisAsset/image19.png')"></div>
        <p>Like her protestant Indologist predecessors, Audrey
            connects Hinduism with Nazism.<br><br>
            Like them, Audrey also has links with Christian
            missionaries.<br><br>
            Why should her personal religion be our problem? Well, but
            for the fact that they don't keep it confined to their personal
            space!<br><br>
            Ausrey's father-in-law Nathan Rehn is a pastor belonging to
            a fundamentalist Christian organization "Win India for
            Christ”.<br><br>
            Like Aurangzeb whom she admires, Audrey's father in law is
            also an outspoken critic of "idol worship"</p>

        <p>These protestant Indologists ignore that the Nazi Hooked
            Cross was conceived in a Christian context. <br><br>
            Hitler’s upbringing was at the Benedictine Christian
            Monastery in Austria which features hooked cross motifs. <br><br>
            It was from a Christian milieu that they picked up "hooked
            cross"</p>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduNazisAsset/image21.png')"></div>
        <p>While protestant Indologists continue to manufacture fake
            association between Hinduism and Nazism, German bishops
            have recently admitted their role. <br><br>
            "We were complicit in Nazi crimes"- German Bishops.</p>
        <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/we-were-complicit-in-nazi-crimes-say-german-bishops-3psjslzsb">Relevant
            Article</a>
        <div class="threadImage" style="background-image: url('HinduNazisAsset/image22.png')"></div>
        <p>While Bishops admitted their role in Nazi Crimes, they
            havent admitted their role in this false association of Hooked
            Cross with Swastika. <br><br>
            It is interesting to note that the first English translation of
            Mein Kampf by Edgar Dugdale did not have "swastika"</p>
        <a href="https://library.abundanthope.org/index_htm_files/mein-kampf-adolf-hitler-1931.pdf">Relevant Article</a>
        <p>Edgar Dugdale correctly translates "Haken Kreuz" as hooked
            cross.<br><br>
            It was only the Christian Pastor Murphy who first used
            "Swastika" in place of "Haken Kreuz" in his (mis)translation
            of Mein Kampf</p>
