        <h1>Kanishka : Buddhist or not ?</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>
            Kanishka was NOT a Buddhist. It is a later day myth. (irrespective of what later non contemporary Buddhist
            literature says).
            <br><br>
            Buddha features in less than one percent of Kanishka's own coins.
            <br><br>
            In his own Rabatak inscription, Kanishka venerates the Goddess Nana. Buddha is absent.
        </p>
        <img src="KanishkaAsset/image.PNG" alt="image">
        <p>The so called "4th Buddhist council" was mentioned by Xuanzang in 7th century CE.
            <br><br>
            It was not even mentioned by Faxian.
            <br><br>
            Xuanzang gives a date of c. 75 CE.
            <br><br>
            Doubtful whether Kanishka was even born by this date.
            <br><br>
            Xuanzang also repeats the later legend.
        </p>
        <img src="KanishkaAsset/image2.PNG" alt="image2">
        <p>Xuanzang also repeats the later mythical legend of Buddha prophesizing the birth of Kanishka and Vasumitra's
            magic.
            <br><br>
            Far removed from Kanishka's lifetime and filled with mythical legends, it is hard to take Xuanzang's account
            of
            Kanishka at face value.
        </p>
        <img src="KanishkaAsset/image3.png" alt="image3">
        <p>In his own Rabatak inscription, Kanishka called himself "son of the Gods".
            <br><br>
            This title (proclaiming semi divinity) is hardly one which an early Buddhist king would use. Buddhist kings
            like
            Ashoka and Tissa rather styled themselves as "beloved of the gods" (Devanampriya)
        </p>
        <img src="KanishkaAsset/image4.png" alt="image4">
        <p>Nowhere in any of his inscriptions does Kanishka call himself "Saugata"/"Paramasaugata"/"Bauddha", titles
            which
            would proclaim his affiliation to Buddhism.
            <br><br>
            Rather, Buddha is completely absent among the Kushan family deities mentioned in the Rabatak inscription.
            Rabatak inscription is near the Kushan royal sanctuary of Surkh Kotal, in their native Afghanistan.
            <br><br>
            This inscription is very important because it gives us a glimpse into what the Kushans actually believed in,
            rather than what they patronized among their Indian subjects.<br><br>
            In the royal sanctuary, Kanishka orders his architect to make a temple for these Gods

        <ol>
            <li>"Glorious" Uma (Parvati)</li>
            <li>Mahasena (Kartikeya)</li>
            <li>Vishakha</li>
            <li>Mihira (Mitra)</li>
            <li>Aurmuzd (Ahuramazda)</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <img src="KanishkaAsset/image5.png" alt="image5">
        <p>It is clear from this inscription that Kanishka worshiped Shaivite Gods. But he also equated them with his
            native
            gods.
            <br><br>
            For example, Kanishka equated Kartikeya with his native Iranic deity Sraosha.
            <br><br>
            Later Kushans equated Nana with Durga. They equated Ardoksho with Lakshmi.
            This is not surprising at all. Coverts to Hinduism do not obliterate their past beliefs. Hinduism does not
            insist in obliteration of past beliefs.
            <br><br>
            Rather the converts identified their native gods with the Hindu Gods in this process of conversion. This has
            always been the case
            Here is a golden coin of Kanishka.
            <br><br>
            Four armed Shiva holding Trishula, Damaru and the Deer is depicted.
            <br><br>
            Kushans worshiped Shiva, identifying him with their native deity Oesho.
            <br><br>
            Shiva featured in the majority of Kanishka's coins.
        </p>
        <img src="KanishkaAsset/image6.jpg" alt="image6">
        <p>Here is a Bactrian Gold coin of Kanishka.
            <br><br>
            The Goddess Ardoksho is depicted holding crop . Kushans identified her with Goddess dhānyalakṣmī .
            <br><br>
            Dhānyalakṣmī also holds a crop of paddy in her hands.
        </p>
        <img src="KanishkaAsset/image7.jpg" alt="image7">
        <p>Here is another Bactrian Gold coin of Kanishka. The Iranic fire God Atar(Atasho) is depicted on this coin.
            <br><br>
            Kushans identified Atar with Agni.
        </p>
        <img src="KanishkaAsset/image8.jpg" alt="image8">
        <p>Here is a bronze coin of Kanishka.
            <br><br>
            It depicts the Indo-Iranian wind God Vata.
            <br><br>
            Of course, even the Vedic people worshiped the same wind God Vata-Vayu.
        </p>
        <img src="KanishkaAsset/image9.jpg" alt="image9">
        <p>Here is a Bronze coin of Kanishka.
            <br><br>
            It depicts the Indo Iranian deity Mitra/Mithra.
            <br><br>
            This God was worshiped by both Vedic people and Iranians.
        </p>
        <img src="KanishkaAsset/image10.jpg" alt="image10">
        <p>What was the religion of Kushans/Kanishka?
            <br><br>
            Kushans were East Iranics by ethnicity. They were NOT Zoroastrian as they worshiped deities NOT found in
            Avesta.
            <br><br>
            As we have seen, Kanishka was not a Buddhist either. He sponsored Peshawar stupa for his Buddhist Gandharan
            subjects
            There was not much difference in the religious beliefs of Vedic Hindus and (Non Zoroastrian) Iranic people.
            <br><br>
            This was the "Arya" background of Kanishka.
            <br><br>
            Interestingly, "Arya" was the self identification of Kanishka. He refers to his native Bactrian language as
            "Arya" language.
        </p>
        <img src="KanishkaAsset/image11.png" alt="image11">
        <p>
            This is what the own record of Kanishka says.
            <br><br>
            But book after book, article after article has identified him as a devout, zealous Buddhist. Why?
            <br><br>
            Their conception of Kanishka was shaped by late, non-contemporary Buddhist writings which depicted him as a
            Buddhist.
            The Buddhist writers were very habitual in this aspect.
            <br><br>
            They even identified king Harshavardhana as a Buddhist. But we know from his own inscriptions that he was a
            Shaivite.
            <br><br>
            The Buddhist writers mistook patronage for religious affiliation.
            However, not all Kushans followed this Indo-Iranian polytheistic pantheon. There were exceptions.
            <br><br>
            Kanishka's father, the Kushan emperor Vima Kadphises was exclusively Hindu & exclusively Shaivite.
            <br><br>
            He inscribed Shiva on ALL his coins. No other deity was represented on his coins
        </p>
        <img src="KanishkaAsset/image12.png" alt="image12">
        <p>
            Buddha was not minted by Vima Kadphises.
            <br><br>
            Buddha is the least common of Indian deities to appear on Kanishka's coin.
            <br><br>
            Buddha was COMPLETELY ignored on the coins of Kanishka's successors Huvishka, Vasudeva and others.
        </p>
        <img src="KanishkaAsset/image13.png" alt="image13">
        <p>
            The later Kushans succeeding Vasudeva ignored the Iranic deities as well.
            <br><br>
            They depicted only Shiva and Ardoksho (Lakshmi) on their coins. The transformation into Shaivism was
            complete.
            The final nail in the coffin:
            <br><br>
            26% of Kanishka's coins feature Oesho/Shiva.
            <br><br>
            22% of his coins feature Nana.
            <br><br>
            Only 1% of Kanishka's coins feature Buddha
